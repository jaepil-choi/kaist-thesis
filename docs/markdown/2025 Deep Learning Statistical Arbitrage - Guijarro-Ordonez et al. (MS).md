## Abstract

Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price diﬀerences between similar assets. We develop a
comprehensive conceptual framework for statistical arbitrage and a novel data driven solution.
First, we construct arbitrage portfolios of similar assets as residual portfolios from conditional
latent asset pricing factors. Second, we extract their time series signals with a powerful machine-
learning time-series solution, a convolutional transformer. Lastly, we use these signals to form
an optimal trading policy, that maximizes risk-adjusted returns under constraints. Our com-
prehensive empirical study on daily US equities shows a high compensation for arbitrageurs to
enforce the law of one price. Our arbitrage strategies obtain consistently high out-of-sample
mean returns and Sharpe ratios, and substantially outperform all benchmark approaches.

## 1 Introduction

Hedge funds and investment banks have for a long time been using investment strategies, which

identify and exploit temporal price diﬀerences between similar assets using statistical methods.

This speciﬁc type of quantitative trading strategy is commonly referred to as statistical arbitrage.

Conceptually, they are based on relative trades between a stock and a mimicking portfolio. The

mimicking portfolio is constructed to be “similar” to the target stock, usually based on historical

co-movements in the price time-series or similar ﬁrm characteristics. When the spread between the

prices of the two comparison assets widens, the arbitrageur sells the winner and buys the loser.

If their prices move back together, the arbitrageur will proﬁt. While Wall Street has developed a

plethora of proprietary tools for sophisticated arbitrage trading, there is still a lack of understanding

of the potential proﬁtability of such strategies in ﬁnancial markets. In this paper we answer the

two key questions around statistical arbitrage: What are the important elements of a successful

arbitrage strategy and how much can be earned in U.S. equity markets?

A quantitative trading strategy that exploits temporal price diﬀerences between similar assets

with statistical methods has to solve the following three key problems: Given a large universe of

assets, what are long-short portfolios of similar assets? Given these portfolios, what are time series

signals that indicate the presence of temporary price deviations? Last, but not least, given these

signals, how should an arbitrageur trade them to optimize a trading objective while taking into

account possible constraints and market frictions? Each of these three questions poses substantial

challenges, that prior work has only partly addressed. First, it is a hard problem to ﬁnd long-

short portfolios for all stocks as it is a priori unknown what constitutes “similarity”. This problem

requires considering all the big data available for a large number of assets and times, including

not just conventional return data but also exogenous information like asset characteristics. Second,

extracting the right signals requires detecting ﬂexibly all the relevant patterns in the noisy, complex,

low-sample-size time series of the portfolio prices. Last but not least, optimal trading rules on a

multitude of signals and assets are complicated and depend on the trading objective. All of these

challenges fundamentally require ﬂexible estimation tools that can deal with many variables. It

is a natural idea to use machine learning techniques like deep neural networks to deal with the

high dimensionality and complex functional dependencies of the problem. However, our problem

is diﬀerent from the usual prediction task, where machine learning tools excel. We show how to

optimally design a machine learning solution to our problem that leverages the economic structure

and objective.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive conceptual framework that generalizes common ap-

proaches to statistical arbitrage. Most existing statistical arbitrage approaches can be decomposed

into three fundamental elements: (1) arbitrage portfolio generation, (2) arbitrage signal extraction

and (3) the arbitrage allocation decision given the signal. By decomposing diﬀerent methods into

their arbitrage portfolio, signal and allocation element, we can compare diﬀerent methods and study

which components are the most relevant for successful trading. For each step we develop a novel

machine learning implementation, which we compare with conventional methods. As a result, we

1

construct a new deep learning statistical arbitrage approach. Our new approach constructs arbi-

trage portfolios with a conditional latent factor model, extracts the signals with one of the most

successful machine learning time-series methods and maps them into a trading allocation with a

ﬂexible neural network. These components are integrated and optimized over a global economic

objective, which maximizes the risk-adjusted return under constraints. Empirically, our general

model outperforms out-of-sample the leading benchmark approaches and provides insights into the

structure of statistical arbitrage.

To construct arbitrage portfolios, we introduce the economically motivated asset pricing per-

spective to create them as residuals relative to asset pricing models. This perspective allows us to

take advantage of the recent developments in asset pricing and to also include a large set of ﬁrm

characteristics in the construction of the arbitrage portfolios. We use fundamental risk factors and

conditional and unconditional statistical factors for our asset pricing models. Similarity between

assets is captured by similar exposure to those factors. Hence, arbitrage portfolios are trades rela-

tive to mimicking stock portfolios, which are well-diversiﬁed portfolios with the same exposure to

risk factors. In the case of statistical principal component factors, the mimicking portfolios corre-

spond to assets with the highest correlation with the target stocks. For an appropriate asset pricing

model, systematic shocks have the same eﬀect on mimicking stock portfolios as on the target stocks.

The residual portfolios relative to the asset pricing factors are tradeable portfolios, which are only

weakly cross-sectionally correlated, and close to orthogonal to ﬁrm characteristics and systematic

factors. Empirically, the residuals have predictable mean reversion patterns. Statistical arbitrage

exploits these temporary deviations of the residuals from their long-term mean.

To detect time series patterns and signals in the residual portfolios, we introduce a ﬁlter perspec-

tive and estimate them with a ﬂexible data-driven ﬁlter based on convolutional networks combined

with transformers. In this way, we do not prescribe a potentially misspeciﬁed function to extract the

time series structure, for example, by estimating the parameters of a given parametric time-series

model, or the coeﬃcients of a decomposition into given basis functions, as in conventional methods.

Instead, we directly learn in a data-driven way what the optimal pattern extraction function is for

our trading objective. The convolutional transformer is the ideal method for this purpose. Con-

volutional neural networks are a state-of-the-art AI method for pattern recognition, in particular

in computer vision. In our case they identify the local patterns in the data and may be thought

as a nonlinear and learnable generalization of conventional kernel-based data ﬁlters. Transformer

networks are among the most successful AI models for time series in natural language processing.

In our model, they combine the local patterns to global time-series patterns. Their combination

results in a data-driven ﬂexible time-series ﬁlter that can essentially extract any complex time-series

signal, while providing an interpretable model.

To ﬁnd the optimal trading allocation, we propose neural networks to map the arbitrage signals

into a complex trading allocation. This generalizes conventional parametric rules, for example ﬁxed

rules based on thresholds, which are only valid under strong model assumptions and a small signal

dimension. Importantly, these components are integrated and optimized over a global economic

2

objective, which maximizes the risk-adjusted return under constraints. This allows our model

to learn the optimal signals and allocation for the actual trading objective, which is diﬀerent

from a prediction objective. The trading objective can maximize the Sharpe ratio or expected

return subject to a risk penalty, while taking into account constraints important to real investment

managers, such as restricting turnover, leverage, or proportion of short trades.

Our comprehensive empirical out-of-sample analysis is based on the daily returns of roughly the

550 largest and most liquid stocks in the U.S. from 1998 to 2016. We estimate the out-of-sample

residuals on a rolling window relative to the empirically most important factor models. These

are observed fundamental factors, for example the Fama-French 5 factors and price trend factors,

locally estimated latent factors based on principal component analysis (PCA) or locally estimated

conditional latent factors that include the information in 46 ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics and are

based on the Instrumented PCA (IPCA) of Kelly et al. (2019). We extract the trading signal with

one of the most successful parametric models, based on the mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

process, a frequency decomposition of the time-series with a Fourier transformation and our novel

convolutional network with transformer. Finally, we compare the trading allocations based on

parametric or nonparametric rules estimated with diﬀerent risk-adjusted trading objectives.

Our empirical main ﬁndings are three-fold. First, our model establishes a new standard for sta-

tistical arbitrage trading. Our deep learning statistical arbitrage model substantially outperforms

all benchmark approaches out-of-sample.

In fact, our model can achieve an impressive annual

Sharpe ratio larger than four. While respecting short-selling constraints we can obtain annual

out-of-sample mean returns of 20%. This performance is four times better than one of the best

parametric arbitrage models, and twice as good as an alternative deep learning model without the

convolutional transformer ﬁlter. These results are particularly impressive as we only trade the

largest and most liquid stocks.

Second, we establish that there is a substantial amount of systematic short-term mispricing in

the U.S. equity market, which can be exploited and corrected by arbitrageurs. Arbitrage signals

are persistent over short time horizons, but decay over longer horizons. While arbitrageurs correct

most mispricing over the horizon of a month, around half of the Sharpe ratio can persist for a

holding period of one week. We show that our arbitrage strategies do not represent a risk-premium

to common sources of risk.

In fact, the proﬁtability of our strategies is orthogonal to market

movements and conventional risk factors including momentum and reversal factors. Importantly,

our arbitrage strategy is feasible and remains proﬁtable in the presence of realistic transaction and

holdings costs. Our statistical arbitrage is also not a temporal phenomena, but is robust to the

periods when it is estimated.

Third, we shed light on what matters methodologically for the construction of a successful

statistical arbitrage strategy. Our comprehensive set of choices for the “building blocks” of statis-

tical arbitrage strategies allows us to evaluate the impact of each component. The trading signal

extraction is the most challenging and separating element among diﬀerent arbitrage models. Sur-

prisingly, the choice of asset pricing factors has only a minor eﬀect on the overall performance.

3

Residuals relative to the ﬁve Fama-French factors and ﬁve locally estimated principal component

factors perform very well with out-of-sample Sharpe ratios above 3.2 for our deep learning model.

Five conditional IPCA factors increase the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio to 4.2, which suggests that

asset characteristics provide additional useful information. Increasing the number of risk factors

beyond ﬁve has only a marginal eﬀect. Similarly, the other benchmark models are robust to the

choice of factor model as long as it contains suﬃciently many factors. The distinguishing element

is the time-series model to extract the arbitrage signal. The convolutional transformer doubles

the performance relative to an identical deep learning model with a pre-speciﬁed frequency ﬁlter.

Importantly, we highlight that time-series modeling requires a time-series machine learning ap-

proach, which takes temporal dependencies into account. An oﬀ-the-shelf nonparametric machine

learning method like conventional neural networks, that estimates an arbitrage allocation directly

from residuals, performs substantially worse. In other words, a ﬂexible allocation policy without a

time-series model is not suﬃcient.

In addition to our main ﬁndings, we have number of additional insights. Successful arbitrage

trading is based on local asymmetric trend and reversion patterns. Our convolutional transformer

framework provides an interpretable representation of the underlying patterns, based on local basic

patterns and global time-series dependency patterns. The building blocks of arbitrage trading

are smooth trend and reversion patterns. The arbitrage trading is short-term and the last 30

trading days seem to capture the relevant information. Interestingly, the direction of policies is

asymmetric. The model reacts quickly on downturn movements, but more cautiously on uptrends.

More speciﬁcally, the global dependency patterns which are the most active in downturn movements

focus only on the most recent 10 days, while those for upward movements focus on the ﬁrst 20 days

in a 30-day window.

We also ﬁnd that time-series-based trading patterns should be extracted from residuals and not

directly from returns. For an appropriate factor model, the residuals are only weakly correlated

and close to stationary in both, the time and cross-sectional dimension. Hence, it is meaningful

to extract a uniform trading pattern, that is based only on the past time-series information, from

the residuals. In contrast stock returns are dominated by a few factors, which severely limits the

actual independent time-series information, and are strongly heterogenous due to their variation in

ﬁrm characteristics. While the level of stock returns is extremely hard to predict, even with ﬂexible

machine learning methods, residuals capture relative movements and remove the level component.

These properties make residuals analyzable from a purely time-series based perspective and, unlike

the existing literature, they allow us to incorporate alternative data into the portfolio construction

process. This also highlights a fundamental diﬀerence with most of the existing ﬁnancial machine

learning literature: We do not use characteristics to get features for prediction, but rather to obtain

the data orthogonal to these features.

Last but not least, we demonstrate that asset pricing modeling and statistical arbitrage modeling

are conceptually diﬀerent but complimentary problems. A model for the stochastic discount factor

(SDF) captures the risk premium of assets, and the implied SDF portfolio earns the risk premium.

4

Statistical arbitrage investing can try to exploit temporal ﬂuctuations around the risk premium. We

can in principal use any asset pricing model to construct the stock-mimicking benchmark portfolios,

and then exploit the temporal ﬂuctuations with our statistical arbitrage model. We show empirically

how risk premia investment and statistical arbitrage can be combined. For a given asset pricing

model, we construct a trading strategy that exploits relative price movements that is orthogonal

to the risk premium captured by this asset pricing model. This allows an investor to earn the risk

premium implied by the asset pricing model and in addition the payoﬀ of the relative ﬂuctuations

captured by statistical arbitrage.

### Related Literature

Our paper builds on the classical statistical arbitrage literature, in which the three main prob-

lems of portfolio generation, pattern extraction, and allocation decision have traditionally been

considered independently. Classical statistical methods of generating arbitrage portfolios have

mostly focused on obtaining multiple pairs or small portfolios of assets, using techniques like the

distance method of Gatev et al. (2006), the cointegration approach of Vidyamurthy (2004), or cop-

ulas as in Rad et al. (2016). In contrast, more general methods that exploit large panels of stock

returns include the use of PCA factor models, as in Avellaneda and Lee (2010) and its extension

in Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017), and the maximization of mean-reversion and sparsity statistics as

in d’Aspremont (2011). We include the model of Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017) as the parametric

benchmark model in our study as it has one of the best empirical performances among the class of

parametric models. Our paper paper contributes to this literature by introducing a general asset

pricing perspective to obtain the arbitrage portfolios as residuals. This allows us to take advantage

of conditional asset pricing models, that include time-varying ﬁrm characteristics in addition to the

return time-series, and provides a more disciplined, economically motivated approach. The signal

extraction step for these models assumes parametric time series models for the arbitrage portfolios,

whereas the allocations are often decided from the estimated parameters by using stochastic con-

trol methods or given threshold rules and one-period optimizations. Some representative papers

of the ﬁrst approach include Jurek and Yang (2007), Mudchanatongsuk et al. (2008), Cartea and

Jaimungal (2016), Lintilhac and Tourin (2016) and Leung and Li (2015), whereas the second one is

illustrated by Elliott et al. (2005) and Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017). Both approaches are special

cases of our more general framework. Mulvey et al. (2020) and Kim and Kim (2019) are exam-

ples of including machine learning elements within the parametric statistical arbitrage framework,

by either solving a stochastic control problem with neural networks or estimating a time-varying

threshold rule with reinforcement learning.

Our paper is complementary to the emerging literature that uses machine learning methods for

asset pricing. While the asset pricing literature aims to explain the risk premia of assets, our focus is

on the residual component which is not explained by the asset pricing models. Chen et al. (2022),

Bryzgalova et al. (2023) and Kozak et al. (2020) estimate the stochastic discount factor (SDF),

which explains the risk premia of assets, with deep neural networks, decision trees or elastic net

5

regularization. These papers employ advanced statistical methods to solve a conditional method of

moment problem in the presence of many variables. The workhorse models in equity asset pricing

are based on linear factor models exempliﬁed by Fama and French (1993, 2015). Recently, new

methods have been developed to extract statistical asset pricing factors from large panels with

various versions of principal component analysis (PCA). The Risk-Premium PCA in Lettau and

Pelger (2020a,b) includes a pricing error penalty to detect weak factors that explain the cross-

section of returns. The high-frequency PCA in Pelger (2020) uses high-frequency data to estimate

local time-varying latent risk factors and the Instrumented PCA (IPCA) of Kelly et al. (2019)

estimates conditional latent factors by allowing the loadings to be functions of time-varying asset

characteristics. Gu et al. (2021) generalize IPCA to allow the loadings to be nonlinear functions of

characteristics. Giglio and Xiu (2021) use PCA factors to account for missing priced factors in risk

premia estimation. He et al. (2022) highlight the important insight that the time-series of residuals

can be informative for trading. They test asset pricing models by studying the proﬁtability of

trading residuals based on high-minus-low sorting strategies of prior residual returns.

Our paper is related to the growing literature on return prediction with machine learning meth-

ods, which has shown the beneﬁts of regularized ﬂexible methods. In their pioneering work Gu et al.

(2020) conduct a comparison of machine learning methods for predicting the panel of individual

U.S. stock returns based on the asset-speciﬁc characteristics and economic conditions in the previ-

ous period. Freyberger et al. (2020) use diﬀerent methods for predicting stock returns. In a similar

spirit, Bianchi et al. (2020) predict bond returns, Li and Rossi (2020) predict mutual fund returns,

and Bali et al. (2022) predict option returns. A related stream extends cross-sectional machine

learning prediction to higher moments and residuals, which are used for investment decisions. Li

and Tang (2022) use machine learning to predict risk measures and estimate conditional volatilities.

Kaniel et al. (2023) and DeMiguel et al. (2023) predict the skill of mutual fund managers based on

residuals from benchmark asset pricing factors. The return prediction literature is fundamentally

estimating the risk premia of assets, while our focus is on understanding and exploiting the tempo-

ral deviations thereof. This diﬀerent goal is reﬂected in the diﬀerent methods that are needed and

diﬀerent variables that are used. These return predictions estimate a nonparametric cross-sectional

model between current returns and large set of covariates from the last period, which are supposed

to capture exposure to systematic risk, but do not estimate a time-series model. In contrast, the

important challenge that we solve is to extract a complex time-series pattern.

A related stream of the return prediction literature forecasts returns using past returns, generally

followed by some long-short investment policy based on the prediction. For example, Krauss et al.
(2017) use various machine learning methods for this type of prediction.1 However, they use general
nonparametric function estimates, which are not speciﬁcally designed for time-series data. Lim and

Zohren (2021) show that it is important for machine learning solutions to explicitly account for

temporal dependence when they are applied to time-series data. Murray et al. (2023) and Jiang et al.

(2022) build on this insight and use machine learning to learn price trends for return forecasting.

1Similar studies include Fischer et al. (2019), Chen et al. (2018), Huck (2009), and Dunis et al. (2006).

Forecasting returns and building a long-short portfolio based on the prediction is diﬀerent from

statistical arbitrage trading as it combines a risk premium and potential arbitrage component. It

is not based on temporary price diﬀerences and also in general not orthogonal to common risk

factors and market movements.

In this paper we highlight the challenge of inferring complex

time-series information and argue that using returns directly as an input to a time-series machine

learning method, can be suboptimal as returns are dominated by a few factor time-series and are

heterogeneous due to cross-sectionally and time-varying characteristics. In contrast, appropriate

residuals are close to uncorrelated and locally cross-sectionally stationary. Hence, appropriate

residuals allow the extraction of a complex time-series pattern.

Naturally, our work overlaps with the literature on using machine learning tools for investment.

The SDF estimated by asset pricing models, like in Chen et al. (2022) and Bryzgalova et al. (2023),

directly maps into a conditionally mean-variance eﬃcient portfolio and hence an attractive invest-

ment opportunity. However, by construction this investment portfolio is not orthogonal but fully

exposed to systematic risk, which is exactly the opposite for an arbitrage portfolio. Prediction

approaches also imply investment strategies, typically long-short portfolios based on the predic-

tion signal. However, estimating a signal with a prediction objective, is not necessarily providing

an optimal signal for investment. Bryzgalova et al. (2023) and Chen et al. (2022) illustrate that

machine learning models that use a trading objective can result in a substantially more proﬁtable

investment than models that estimate a signal with a prediction objective, while using the same

information as input and having the same ﬂexibility. This is also conﬁrmed in Cong et al. (2021),

who use an investment objective and reinforcement learning to construct machine learning invest-

ment portfolios. Our paper contributes to this literature by estimating investment strategies, that

are orthogonal to systematic risk, exploit relative time-series patterns and are based on a trading

objective with constraints.

Finally, our approach is also informed by the recent deep learning for time series literature. The

transformer method was ﬁrst introduced in the groundbreaking paper by Vaswani et al. (2017). We

are the ﬁrst to bring this idea into the context of statistical arbitrage and adopt it to the economic

problem.

## 2 Model

The fundamental problem of statistical arbitrage consists of three elements: (1) The identiﬁca-

tion of similar assets to generate arbitrage portfolios, (2) the extraction of time-series signals for

the temporary deviations of the similarity between assets and (3) a trading policy in the arbitrage

portfolios based on the time-series signals. We discuss each element separately.

### 2.1 Arbitrage portfolios

We consider a panel of excess returns Rn,t, that is the return minus risk free rate of stock
n = 1, ..., Nt at time t = 1, ..., T . The number of available assets at time t can be time-varying.

7

The excess return vector of all assets at time t is denoted as Rt =

(cid:16)

R1,t

· · · RNt,t

(cid:17)(cid:62)

.

We use asset pricing models to identify similar assets. In this context, similarity is deﬁned as

the same exposure to systematic risk, which implies that assets with the same risk exposure should

have the same fundamental value implied by the asset pricing model. We assume that asset returns

can be modeled by a conditional factor model:

Rn,t = β(cid:62)

n,t−1Ft + (cid:15)n,t.

The K factors F ∈ RT ×K capture the systematic risk, while the risk loadings βt−1 ∈ RNt×K can be
general functions of the information set at time t − 1 and hence can be time-varying. This general

formulation includes the empirically most successful factor models. In our empirical analysis we

will include observed traded factors, e.g. the Fama-French 5 factor model, latent factors based on

the principal components analysis (PCA) of stock returns and conditional latent factors estimated

with Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA).

Without loss of generality, we can treat the factors as excess returns of traded assets. Either

the factors are traded, for example a market factor, in which case we include them in the returns
Rt. Otherwise, we can generate factor mimicking portfolios by projecting them on the asset space,
as for example with latent factors:

Ft = wF

t−1

(cid:62)

Rt.

We deﬁne arbitrage portfolios as residual portfolios (cid:15)n,t = Rn,t − β(cid:62)
n,t−1Ft. As factors are traded
assets, the arbitrage portfolios are themselves traded portfolios. Hence, the vector of residual

portfolios equals

(cid:15)t = Rt − βt−1wF

t−1

(cid:62)

Rt =

(cid:16)

(cid:124)

INt − βt−1wF

t−1

(cid:123)(cid:122)
Φt−1

(cid:62)(cid:17)

(cid:125)

Rt = Φt−1Rt.

Arbitrage portfolios are trades relative to mimicking stock portfolios. The factor component

in the residuals corresponds to a well-diversiﬁed mimicking portfolio, that is is “close” to the

speciﬁc stock in the relative trade. More speciﬁcally, in the case of PCA factors, we construct

well-diversiﬁed portfolios of stocks that have the highest correlation with each target stock in the

relative trades. This is conceptually the same idea as using some form of clustering algorithm to
construct a portfolio of highly correlated stocks.2 Hence, residuals of PCA factors construct relative
trades based on correlations in past return time-series. In the case of IPCA factors, we intuitively

construct for each stock a well-diversiﬁed mimicking portfolio that is as similar as possible in terms

of the underlying ﬁrm characteristics. Hence, the mimicking portfolio represents an asset with very

similar ﬁrm fundamentals. Lastly, for Fama-French factors, we construct mimicking portfolios with

the same exposure to those fundamental factors. In all cases, the choice of factor model implies a

notion of similarity. By construction, the mimicking portfolio and the target stock have identical

loadings to the selected factors.

Arbitrage trading relative to mimicking portfolios takes advantage of all assets in the market.

In practice and modern statistical arbitrage theory, it has replaced the more restrictive idea of

pairs trading, which considers relative trades between only two stocks. On an intuitive level, the

mimicking portfolio represents the reference asset in the relative trade. It can be constructed even

if there does not exist an individual stock that is highly correlated with a target stock.

It is helpful to provide an asset pricing perspective on arbitrage portfolios based on resid-

uals. The key idea of statistical arbitrage is to exploit predictable patterns in the time-series of

residual portfolios. Traditionally, statistical arbitrage focuses on mean-reversion patterns. A mean-

stationary process implies that after large deviations from its unconditional mean, it is expected

to mean-revert. Our arbitrage portfolios are projections on the return space that annihilate sys-

tematic asset risk. In the extreme case, when the selected asset pricing model can price all the

stocks, the residual portfolios would not earn a risk premium. This would imply that the uncon-

ditional mean of the residuals, which is commonly referred to as alpha, would be equal to zero,
that is E[(cid:15)n,t] = 0. This represents a particular case of a potentially mean-stationary process with
zero mean. The cumulative returns of residuals can ﬂuctuate around their fundamental value, and

statistical arbitrage tries to estimate time-series models that can exploit the temporal patterns for

deviations from this benchmark.

Importantly, we do not assume that our candidate asset pricing model for residual construction

perfectly prices all individual stocks. Statistical arbitrage can exploit time-series patterns in residual

returns even when the residual mean is diﬀerent from zero, that is, when there are non-zero alphas.
Residuals with non-zero means, that is, E[(cid:15)n,t] = αn, imply cumulative residual returns with a
trend. As we will see, such residuals can still have mean-reversion patterns around this trend, which

result in two types of predictable patterns, namely a monotonic trend and predictable ﬂuctuations

around it. A ﬂexible time-series model like our framework can exploit both types of patterns. These

types of trends can also arise because of long mean-reversion cycles that locally look like monotonic

trends. In summary, we use asset pricing models to construct a benchmark portfolios, and study

which types of benchmark portfolios lead to residual time-series with time-series patterns that can

be exploited for trading. As we will see, the models, that we consider for statistical arbitrage

trading, obtain their largest proﬁtability only if we consider suﬃciently rich factor models.

Residual portfolios have the desirable property that they are only weakly cross-sectionally de-

pendent. We conﬁrm empirically that once we use suﬃciently many statistical or fundamental

factors the residuals are indeed close to uncorrelated and a large fraction have an average mean

close to zero. Hence, it is reasonable to view residuals as independent draws from the same class

of distribution and extract a uniform time-series pattern from the panel of residuals. Without the

large cross-sectional dimension, it would not be feasible to learn a complex time-series model.

### 2.2 Arbitrage signal

The arbitrage signal is extracted from the time-series of the arbitrage portfolios. These time-

series signals are the input for a trading policy. An example for an arbitrage signal would be a

parametric model for mean reversion that is estimated for each arbitrage portfolio. The trading

strategy for each arbitrage portfolio would depend on its speed of mean reversion and its deviation

from the long run mean. More generally, the arbitrage signal is the estimation of a time-series model,

which can be parametric or nonparametric. An important class of models are ﬁltering approaches.

Conceptually, time-series models are multivariate functional mappings between sequences, which

take into account the temporal order of the elements and potentially complex dependencies between

the elements of the input sequence.

We apply the signal extraction to the time-series of the last L lagged residuals, which we denote

in vector notation as

(cid:16)

(cid:15)L
n,t−1 :=

(cid:15)n,t−L · · ·

(cid:15)n,t−1

(cid:17)

.

The arbitrage signal function is a mapping θ ∈ Θ from RL to Rp, where Θ deﬁnes an appropriate
function space:

θn,t−1 = θ((cid:15)L

n,t−1).

The signals θn,t−1 ∈ Rp for the arbitrage portfolio n at time t only depend on the time-series
of lagged returns (cid:15)L
n,t−1. Note that the dimensionality of the signal can be the same as for
the input sequence. We use the notation of evaluating functions elementwise, that is θ((cid:15)L
t−1) =
(cid:16)
t−1 =

The arbitrage signal θn,t−1 is a suﬃcient statistic for the trading policy; that is, all relevant
information for trading decisions is summarized in it. This also implies that two arbitrage portfolios

with the same signal get the same weight in the trading strategy. More formally, this means that the

arbitrage signal deﬁnes equivalence classes for the arbitrage portfolios. The most relevant signals

summarize reversal patterns and their direction with a small number of parameters. A potential

trading policy could be to hold long positions in residuals with a predicted upward movement and

go short in residuals that are in a downward cycle.

This problem formulation makes two implicit assumptions. First, the cumulative residual time-

series follow the same class of distribution (for example the same stochastic process up to diﬀerent

parameters) over time and in the cross-section. This means that we can learn time-series pattern

that are shared among residuals from diﬀerent stocks, and these patterns are expected to hold in

the future. Asset speciﬁc diﬀerences, that are relevant for trading, are captured by the arbitrage
signals θn,t−1. Second, the ﬁrst L lagged returns are a suﬃcient statistic to obtain the arbitrage
signal θn,t−1. The lookback window can be chosen to be arbitrarily large, but in practice it is
limited by the availability of lagged returns. This is a very general framework that includes the

most important models for ﬁnancial time-series.

### 2.3 Arbitrage trading

The trading policy assigns an investment weight to each arbitrage portfolio based on its signal.

The allocation weight is the solution to an optimization problem, which models a general risk-return

tradeoﬀ and can also include trading frictions and constraints. An important case are mean-variance

eﬃcient portfolios with transaction costs and short sale constraints.

An arbitrage allocation is a mapping from Rp to R in a function class W , that assigns a weight
n,t−1 for the arbitrage portfolio (cid:15)n,t−1 in the investment strategy using only the arbitrage signal

w(cid:15)
θn,t:

w(cid:15)

n,t−1 = w(cid:15)(θn,t−1).

The allocation function is the solution to a trading objective. We consider arbitrage trading

that maximizes the Sharpe ratio or achieves the highest average return for a given level of variance

risk. More speciﬁcally we will solve for

for some risk aversion parameter γ.3

In the presence of trading costs, we calculate the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio net return by
subtracting from the portfolio return wR
t−1Rt the trading costs that are associated with the stock
allocation wR
t−1. The trading costs can capture the transaction costs from frequent rebalancing and
the higher costs of short selling compared to long positions. The stock weights wR
t−1 are normalized
to add up to one in absolute value, which implicitly imposes a leverage constraint. We discuss the

formal treatment of trading costs in our empirical analysis, where we consider a trading objective

with and without trading costs.

This is a combined optimization problem, which simultaneously solves for the optimal allocation

function and arbitrage signal function. As the weight is a composition of the two functions, that
is w(cid:15)
t−1)), the decomposition into a signal and allocation function is in general not

t−1 = w(cid:15)(θ((cid:15)L

3Our framework is general and allows for any concave utility function U (·), for which we can estimate the con-
ditional expected utility given the time-series of the trading strategy. A general allocation function is the solution

Although we optimize an unconstrained objective, our allocation model can incorporate constraints as well. For
example, soft constraints can be incorporated using additional penalty terms in the optimization objective. Hard
constraints can be incorporated via barrier function terms in the optimization objective.

uniquely identiﬁed. This means there can be multiple representations of θ and w(cid:15), that will result in
the same trading policy. We use a decomposition that allows us to compare the problem to classical

arbitrage approaches, for which this separation is uniquely identiﬁed. The key feature of the signal

function θ is that it models a time-series, that means it is a mapping that explicitly models the
t−1. The allocation function w(cid:15) can
temporal order and the dependency between the elements of (cid:15)L
be a complex nonlinear function, but does not explicitly model time-series behavior. This means
that w(cid:15) is implicitly limited in the dependency patterns of its input elements that it can capture.
Many relevant models estimate the signal and allocation function separately. The arbitrage

signals can be estimated as the parameters of a parametric time-series model, the serial moments

for a given stationary distribution or a given time-series ﬁlter. In these cases, the signal estimation

solves a separate optimization problem as part of the estimation. Given the signals, the allocation

function for a Sharpe ratio objective is the solution of

We estimate the signal and allocation function in a pooled panel estimation over the cross-
section of residuals. In other words, we apply the same functions θ and w(cid:15) to the full cross-section
of residuals. This allows us to leverage the large cross-sectional dimension to estimate complex
time-series patterns and allocation functions.4

We provide an extensive study of the importance of the diﬀerent elements in statistical arbitrage

trading. We ﬁnd that the most important driver for proﬁtable portfolios is the arbitrage signal

function; that is, a good model to extract time-series patterns is essential. The arbitrage portfolios

of asset pricing models, that are suﬃciently rich, result in roughly the same performance. Once

an informative signal is extracted, parametric and nonparametric allocation functions can take

advantage of it. We ﬁnd that the key element is to consider a suﬃciently general class of functions

Θ for the arbitrage signal and to estimate the signal that is the most relevant for trading. In other

words, the largest gains in statistical arbitrage come from ﬂexible time-series signals θ and a joint

optimization problem.

### 2.4 Models for Arbitrage Signal and Allocation Functions

In this section we introduce diﬀerent functional models for the signal and allocation functions.

They range from the most restrictive assumptions for simple parametric models to the most ﬂexible

model, which is our sophisticated deep neural network architecture. The general problem is the

estimation of a signal and allocation function given the residual time-series. Here, we take the

residual returns as given, i.e. we have selected an asset pricing model. In order to illustrate the

key elements of the allocation functions, we consider trading the residuals directly. Projecting the

4Note that for pre-speciﬁed linear ﬁlters and parametric models, the pooled estimation in Equation 6 estimates

only the allocation function w(cid:15).

Figure 1: Conceptual Arbitrage Model

This ﬁgure illustrates the conceptual structure of our statistical arbitrage framework. The model takes as input the last L
cumulative returns of a residual portfolio on a lookback window at a given time and outputs the predicted optimal allocation
weight for that residual for the next time. The model is composed of a signal extraction function and an allocation function.

residuals back into the original return space is identical for the diﬀerent methods and discussed in

the empirical part. The conceptual steps are illustrated in Figure 1.

The input to the signal extraction functions are the last L cumulative residuals. We simplify

the notation by dropping the time index t − 1 and the asset index n and deﬁne the generic input

vector

x := Int (cid:0)(cid:15)L

n,t−1

l=1 (cid:15)n,t−L−1+l

· · · (cid:80)L

l=1 (cid:15)n,t−L−1+l

(cid:17)

.

Here the operation Int(·) simply integrates a discrete time-series. We can view the cumulative

residuals as the residual “price” process. We discuss three diﬀerent classes of models for the signal

function θ that vary in the degree of ﬂexibility of the type of patterns that they can capture.
Similarly, we consider diﬀerent classes of models for the allocation function w(cid:15).

#### 2.4.1 Parametric Models

Our ﬁrst benchmark method is a parametric model and corresponds to classical mean-reversion

trading. In this framework, the cumulative residuals x are assumed to be the discrete realizations

of continuous time model:

(cid:16)

x =

X1

· · · XL

(cid:17)

.

Following the inﬂuential papers by Avellaneda and Lee (2010) and Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017)
we model Xt as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process

dXt = κ (µ − Xt) dt + σdBt

for a Brownian motion Bt. These are the standard models for mean-reversion trading and Avel-
laneda and Lee (2010) among others have shown their good empirical performance.

The parameters of this model are estimated from the moments of the discretized time-series, as

13

described in detail along with the other implementation details in Appendix B.2. The parameters

for each residual process, the last cumulative sum and a goodness of ﬁt measure form the signals

for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model:

θOU =

(cid:16)

ˆκ ˆµ ˆσ XL R2(cid:17)

.

Following Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017) we also include the goodness of ﬁt parameter R2 as part of
the signal. R2 has the conventional deﬁnition of the ratio of squared values explained by the model
normalized by total squared values. If the R2 value is too low, the predictions of the model seem
to be unreliable, which can be taken into account in a trading policy. Hence, for each cumulative
residual vector (cid:15)L

n,t−1 we obtain the signal

(cid:16)

n,t−1 =

l=1 (cid:15)n,t−1+l R2

(cid:17)

.

Avellaneda and Lee (2010) and Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017) advocate a classical mean-reversion
thresholding rule, which implies the following allocation function5:

w(cid:15)|OU (cid:0)θOU(cid:1) =

The threshold parameters cthresh and ccrit are tuning parameters. The strategy suggests to buy
or sell residuals based on the ratio XL−µ
. If this ratio exceeds a threshold, it is likely that the
2κ
process reverts back to its long term mean, which starts the trading. If the R2 value is too low, the
predictions of the model seem to be unreliable, which stops the trading. This will be our parametric

√

benchmark model. It has a parametric model for both the signal and allocation function.

Figure A.2 in the Appendix illustrates this model with an empirical example. In this ﬁgure

we show the allocation weights and signals of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with threshold model as

well as the more ﬂexible models that we are going to discuss next. The models are estimated

on the empirical data, and the residual is a representative empirical example. In more detail, we

consider the residuals from ﬁve IPCA factors and estimate the benchmark models as explained in

the empirical Section 3.15. The left subplots display the cumulative residual process along with the
out-of-sample allocation weights w(cid:15)
l that each model assigns to this speciﬁc residual. The evaluation
of this illustrative example is a simpliﬁcation of the general model that we use in our empirical main

analysis. In this example, we consider trading only this speciﬁc residual and hence normalize the

weights to {−1, 0, 1}. In our empirical analysis we trade all residuals and map them back into the

original stock returns. The middle column shows the time-series of estimated out-of-sample signals
for each model, by applying the θl arbitrage signal function to the previous L = 30 cumulative

5The allocation function is derived by maximizing an expected trading proﬁt. This deviates slightly from our
objective of either maximizing the Sharpe ratio or the expected return subject to a variance penalty. As this is the
most common arbitrage trading rule, we include it as a natural benchmark.

returns of the residual. The right column displays the out-of-sample cumulative returns of trading

this particular residual based on the corresponding allocation weights.

The last row in Figure A.2 shows the results for the OU+Threshold model. The cumulative

return of trading this residual is negative, suggesting that the parametric model fails. The residual

time-series with the corresponding allocation weights in subplot (g) explains why. The trading

allocation does not assign a positive weight during the uptrend and wrongly assigns a constant

negative weight, when the residual price process follows a mean-reversion pattern with positive and

negative returns. A parametric model can break down if it is misspeciﬁed. This is not only the case

for trend patterns, but also if there are multiple mean reversion patterns of diﬀerent frequencies.
Subplot (h) shows the signal.6 We see that changes in the allocation function are related to sharp
changes in at least one of the signals, but overall, the signal does not seem to represent the complex

price patterns of the residual.

A natural generalization is to allow for a more ﬂexible allocation function given the same time-

series signals. We will consider for all our models also a general feedforward neural network (FFN)

to map the signal into an allocation weight. FFNs are nonparametric estimators that can capture
very general functional relationships.7 Hence, we also consider the additional model that restricts
the signal function, but allows for a ﬂexible allocation function:

w(cid:15)|OU-FFN (cid:0)θOU(cid:1) = gFFN (cid:0)θOU(cid:1) .

We will show empirically that the gains of a ﬂexible allocation function are minor relative to the

very simple parametric model.

#### 2.4.2 Pre-Speciﬁed Filters

As a generalization of the restrictive parametric model of the last subsection, we consider

more general time-series models. Many relevant time-series models can be formulated as ﬁltering

problems. Filters are transformations of time-series that provide an alternative representation of

the original time-series which emphasizes certain dynamic patterns.

A time-invariant linear ﬁlter can be formulated as

θl =

L
(cid:88)

j=1

W ﬁlter

xj,

which is a linear mapping from RL into RL with the matrix W ﬁlter ∈ RL×L. The estimation
of causal ARMA processes is an example for such ﬁlters. A spectral decomposition based on a

√

6For better readability we have scaled the parameters of the OU process by a factor of ﬁve, but this still represents
the same model as the scaling cancels out in the allocation function. As a minor modiﬁcation, we use the ratio
σ/
2κ as a signal instead of two individual parameters, as the conventional regression estimator of the OU process
directly provides the ratio, but requires additional moments for the individual parameters. However, this results in
an equivalent presentation of the model as only the ratio enters the allocation function.

7Appendix B.1 provides the details for estimating a FFN as a functional mapping gFFN : Rp → R.

frequency ﬁlter is the most relevant ﬁlter for our problem of ﬁnding mean reversion patterns.

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) provides a frequency decomposition of the original time-series

and separates the movements into mean reverting processes of diﬀerent frequencies. FFT applies
L j in the complex plane, but for real-valued time-series it is equivalent to
the ﬁlter W FFT

(cid:17)

∈ RL.

The coeﬃcients al and bl can be interpreted as “loadings” or exposure to long or short-term reversal
patterns. Note that the FFT is an invertible transformation. Hence, it simply represents the original

time-series in a diﬀerent form without losing any information. It is based on the insight that not

the magnitude of the original data but the relative relationship in a time-series matters.

We use a ﬂexible feedforward neural network for the allocation function

w(cid:15)|FFT (cid:0)θFFT(cid:1) = gFFN (cid:0)θFFT(cid:1) .

The usual intuition behind ﬁltering is to use the frequency representation to cut oﬀ frequencies

that have low coeﬃcients and therefore remove noise in the representation. The FFN is essentially

implementing this ﬁltering step of removing less important frequencies.

We illustrate the model within our running example in Figure A.2. The middle row shows the

results for the FFT+FFN model. The cumulative residual in subplot (d) seems to be a combination

of low and high-frequency movements with an initial trend component. The signal in subplot (e)

suggests that the FFT ﬁlter seems to capture the low frequency reversal pattern. However, it

misses the high-frequency components as indicated by the simplistic allocation function. The

trading strategy takes a long position for the ﬁrst half and a short position for the second part.

While this simple allocation results in a positive cumulative return, in this example it neglects the

more complex local reversal patterns.

While the FFT framework is an improvement over the simple OU model as it can deal with

multiple combined mean-reversion patterns of diﬀerent frequencies, it fails if the data follows a

pattern that cannot be well approximated by a small number of the pre-speciﬁed basis functions.

For completeness, our empirical analysis will also report the case of a trivial ﬁlter, which simply

takes the residuals as signals, and combines them with a general allocation function:

θident(x) = x = θident
θident(cid:17)

= gFFN (x) .

w(cid:15)|FFN (cid:16)

16

This is a good example to emphasize the importance of a time-series model. While FFNs are

ﬂexible in learning low dimensional functional relationships, they are limited in learning a complex

dependency model. For example, the FFN architecture we consider is not suﬃciently ﬂexible

to learn the FFT transformation and hence has a worse performance on the original time-series

compared to frequency-transformed time-series. While Xiaohong Chen and White (1999) have

shown that FFNs are “universal approximators” of low-dimensional functional relationships, they

also show that FFN can suﬀer from a curse of dimensionality when capturing complex dependencies

between the input. Although the time domain and frequency domain representations of the input

are equivalent under the Fourier transform, clearly the time-series model implied by the frequency

domain representation allows for a more eﬀective learning of an arbitrage policy. However, the

choice of the pre-speciﬁed ﬁlter limits the time-series patterns that can be exploited. The solution

is our data driven ﬁlter presented in the next section.

#### 2.4.3 Convolutional Neural Network with Transformer

Our benchmark machine learning model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined

with a Transformer. It uses advanced state-of-the-art machine learning tools tailored to learning

patterns in sequences with a trading objective. Convolutional networks are in fact among the

most successful networks for computer vision, i.e. for pattern detection. Transformers have rapidly

become the model of choice for sequence modeling such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)

problems, replacing older recurrent neural network models such as the Long Short-Term Memory

(LSTM) network.

The CNN and transformer framework has two key elements: (1) Local ﬁlters and (2) the

temporal combination of these local ﬁlters. The CNN can be interpreted as a set of data driven

ﬂexible local ﬁlters. A transformer can be viewed as a data driven ﬂexible time-series model to

capture complex dependencies between local patterns. We use the CNN+Transformer to generate

the time-series signal. The allocation function is then modeled as a ﬂexible data driven allocation

with an FFN.

The CNN estimates D local ﬁlters of size Dsize:

y(0)
l =

Dsize(cid:88)

m=1

W (0)

m xl−m+1

for a matrix W (0) ∈ RDsize×D. The local ﬁlters are a mapping from x ∈ RL to y(0) ∈ RL×D given
by the convolution y(0) = W (0) ∗ x. Figure 2 shows examples of these local ﬁlters for Dsize = 3.
The values of y(0) can be interpreted as the “loadings” or exposure to local basis patterns. For
example, if x represents a global upward trend, its ﬁltered representation should have mainly large

values for the local upward trend ﬁlter.

The convolutional mapping can be repeated in multiple layers to obtain a multi-layer CNN.

First, the output of the ﬁrst layer of the CNN is transformed nonlinearly by applying the ReLU(·)

The ﬁnal output of the CNN is ˜x ∈ RL×D.

Our benchmark model is a 2-layered convolutional neural network. The number of layers is

a hyperparameter selected on the validation data. Figure 3 illustrates the structure of the 2-

layer CNN. While this description captures all the conceptual elements, the actual implementation

includes additional details, such as bias terms, instance normalization and residual connection to

improve the implementation as explained in Appendix B.3. Our benchmark 2-layer CNN is local

ﬁlter for three consecutive days, that is, it represents local patterns on a local window of three days
(in technical terms, its receiptive ﬁeld is 3 days).8

8Stacking multiple convolutional mappings increases the length of the local ﬁlters. The length of the local ﬁlter
of a CNN is known as the CNN’s receptive ﬁeld Araujo et al. (2019), which we refer to as the local window size for a
multi-layer CNN. The receptive ﬁeld can be calculated for CNNs given the size (i.e. Dsize), stride, and padding of the
convolutional mappings and is useful for characterizing the local ﬁlters that the CNN comprises. A full treatment of
receptive ﬁeld computation can be found in Araujo et al. (2019). However, our model’s 2-layered CNN with Dsize = 2,
a stride of 1, and left-padding of 1 produces a local ﬁlter with a receptive ﬁeld of three. In simpler language, our
CNN can recognize local sequential patterns of length three. To be more concrete, the input to the CNN is a 30
dimensional vector. The output is a matrix of dimension 30 × 8 in terms of the patterns of the local window size 3. As
this CNN has two layers, the ﬁrst layer takes the relationship between two neighboring points of the 30-dimensional
input vector and transforms this vector into a 30×8 matrix. This matrix is the input to the second convolution, which
applies a similar operation but now to two neighboring vectors of dimension 8. In other words, the matrix W (1)
d,j,m
has dimension 8 × 2 and is applied to 30 − 1 pairs. Hence, the output of the second layer combines the information
of three consecutive time points in a non-linear way.

This ﬁgure shows the structure of our convolutional network. The network takes as input a window of L consecutive daily

capture more complex patterns as it applies a 3-dimensional weighting scheme in the array W (1)
and nonlinear transformations. In order to visualize the type of patterns, we project the local ﬁlter

into a linear local ﬁlter. We want to ﬁnd the basic patterns that activate only one of the D ﬁlters,
but none of the others, i.e. we are looking for an orthogonal representation of the projection.9

The example plots for local ﬁlters in Figure 2 are projections of our higher dimensional nonlinear

ﬁlter into two-dimensional linear ﬁlters. The examples show some of the most important local

ﬁlters for our empirical benchmark model. While these projections are of course not complete

representations of the nonlinear ﬁlters of the CNN, they provide an intuition for the type of patterns
which are activated by speciﬁc ﬁlters. Our 2-layer CNN network with Dsize = 2 has a local window
size, or receptive ﬁeld, of three days as the 2-layer structure combines information of two neighboring

points iteratively. Hence, the projection on a one-dimensional linear ﬁlter has a local window size

of three as depicted in Figure 2.

The output of the CNN ˜x ∈ RL×D is used as an input to the transformer. The CNN projection
provides a more informative representation of the dynamics than the original time-series as it

captures the relative local dependencies between data points. However, by construction the CNN

is only a local representation, and we need the transformer network to detect the global patterns.

A transformer network is a model of temporal dependencies between local ﬁlters. Given the local

structure ˜x the transformer estimates the temporal interactions between the L diﬀerent blocks by

computing a “global pattern projection”.

9A local ﬁlter can be formalized as a mapping from the local Dsize points of a sequence to the activation of the
D ﬁlters: φ : RDsize → RD. Denote by ed ∈ RD a vector that is 0 everywhere except for the value 1 at position d,
i.e. ed = (cid:0)0
· · · 0(cid:1). Fundamentally, we want to invert the local ﬁlter to obtain φ−1(ed) to ﬁnd the local
sequences that only activates ﬁlter d. In general, the inverse is a set and not unique. Our example basic patterns in

Assume that there are H diﬀerent global patterns. The transformer will calculate projections

on these H patterns with the “attention weights”. We ﬁrst introduce a simpliﬁed linear projection

model before extending it to the actual transformer. For each of the i = 1, ..., H patterns we have

αi,j = α(i) (˜xL, ˜xj)

for i = 1, ..., H and j = 1, ..., L.

Each projection hsimple

interpreted as “loadings” or “exposure” for a speciﬁc “pattern factor” αi. For example, a global
upward trend can be captured by an attention function that puts weight on subsequent local upward

The fundamental challenge is to learn attention functions that can model complex dependencies.
The crucial innovation in transformers is their modeling of the attention functions α(i) and attention
heads hi. In order to deal with the high dimensionality of the problem, transformers consider lower
dimensional projections of ˜x into RD/H and use the lower-dimensional scaled dot product attention
mechanism for α(i) as explained in Appendix B.3. More speciﬁcally, each attention head hi ∈ RD/H
is based on11 the projected input ˜xW V

The projection on all global basis patterns hproj ∈ RD is given by a weighted linear combination

10This illustrates how an investment objective diﬀers from applications like NLP. For an investment decision we
want to use all information in the past to understand how they aﬀect the ﬁnal point in the time series when we make
an investment decision. When understanding text or language, we might want to use future words to understand the
meaning of a word at the beginning of the text. In principle, we can create signals using all dependencies captured by
the attention function α(i) (˜xl, ˜xj) for l, j = 1, ..., L. This would result in a L × H dimensional signal matrix instead
of an H dimensional signal vector. However, conceptually the global pattern at the end of the time period should be
the most relevant for the investment objective. We have also implemented a transformer that uses the full matrix,
with similar results and the variable importance rankings suggest that only the dependencies with the ﬁnal point are
selected. The Appendix discusses the more general architecture in more detail.

11The actual implementation also includes bias terms which we neglect here for simplicity. The Appendix provides

the implementation details.

Figure 4: Transformer Network Architecture

This ﬁgure shows the structure of our transformer network. The model takes as input the matrix ˜x ∈ RL×D that we obtain
as output of the convolutional network depicted in Figure 3, which contains D features for each of the L blocks of the original
time series. These features are projected onto H attention heads, which capture the global temporal dependency patterns.
The projections on these attention heads represent our arbitrage signals, which are the input to the feedforward network
that estimates the allocation weight for the residual on the next day. “Add & normalize” denotes the combination of layer
normalization and residual connection proposed as part of the transformer in Vaswani et al. (2017).

global patterns. This is analogous to a Fourier ﬁlter, but without pre-specifying the global patterns

a priori. All parts of the CNN+Transformer network, i.e. the local patterns, the attention functions

and the projections on global patterns, are estimated from the data.

The trading signal θCNN+Trans equals the global pattern projection hproj combined with local
CNN ﬁlters and summarizes the trading signal for an input time-series x ∈ RL. The trading signal
θCNN+Trans is then used as input to a time-wise feedforward network allocation function

w(cid:15)|CNN+Trans (cid:0)θCNN+Trans(cid:1) = gFFN (cid:0)θCNN+Trans(cid:1) .

The separation between signal and allocation is not uniquely identiﬁed as we use a joint optimization

problem. We have chosen a separation that maps naturally into the classical examples considered
in the previous subsections. Figure 4 illustrates the transformer network architecture.12 We have

data can be used as input in more iterations of the transformer to obtain a multi-layer transformer.

We illustrate the CNN+Transformer model in the ﬁrst row of Figure A.2 in the Appendix for

an empirical residual example. First, it is apparent that the cumulative returns of the strategy in

subplot (c) outperforms the previous two models. This is because the allocation weights in subplot

(a) capture not only the low frequency reversal patterns, but also the high-frequency cycles and

trend components. This also implies that the allocation weights change more frequently to capture

the higher frequency components. This more sophisticated allocation function requires a more

complex signal as illustrated in subplot (b). Each change in the allocation can be traced back to

changes in at least one of the signals. While the signals themselves are hard to interpret, we will

leverage the transformer structure to extract interpretable “global dependency factors” in our main

analysis. Figure A.3 in the Appendix provides another example to illustrate the diﬀerences between

the three models. This example has a strong negative trend component with a superimposed mean-

reversion. Only the CNN+Transformer captures both type of patterns.

## 3 Empirical Analysis

### 3.1 Data

We collect daily equity return data for the securities on CRSP from January 1978 through

December 2016. We use the ﬁrst part of the sample to estimate the various factor models, which

gives us the residuals for the time period from January 1998 to December 2016 for the arbitrage

trading. The arbitrage strategies trade on a daily frequency at the close of each day. We use the

daily adjusted returns to account for dividends and splits and the one-month Treasury bill rates

from the Kenneth French Data Library as the risk-free rate. In addition, we complement the stock

returns with the 46 ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics from Chen et al. (2022), which are listed in Table

A.I. All these variables are constructed either from accounting variables from the CRSP/Compustat

database or from past returns from CRSP. The full details on the construction of these variables

are in the Internet Appendix of Chen et al. (2022).

Our analysis uses only the most liquid stocks in order to avoid trading and market friction

issues. More speciﬁcally, we consider only the stocks whose market capitalization at the previous

month was larger than 0.01% of the total market capitalization at that previous month, which is

the same selection criterion as in Kozak et al. (2020). On average this leaves us with approximately

the largest 550 stocks, which correspond roughly to the S&P 500 index. This is an unbalanced

dataset, as the stocks that we consider each month need not be the same as in the next month,

but it is essentially balanced on a daily frequency in rolling windows of up to one year in our

output of the prior layer f (x), followed by (b) a layer normalization of the sum x + f (x). The residual connection
and layer normalization are performed to stabilize and speed up the training of neural networks as reported in e.g.
He et al. (2016); Ba et al. (2016); Xu et al. (2019). While many improvements of normalized residual connections
have been investigated in the literature, we use the original transformer “add and normalize” operation for ease of
explainability.

trading period from 1998 through 2016. For each stock we have its cross-sectionally centered and

rank-transformed characteristics of the previous month. This is a standard transformation to deal

with the diﬀerent scales which is robust to outliers and time-variation, and has also been used in

Chen et al. (2022), Kozak et al. (2020), Kelly et al. (2019), and Freyberger et al. (2020).

Our daily residual time-series start in 1998 as we have a large number of missing values in daily
individual stock returns prior to this date, but almost no missing daily values in our sample.13 We
want to point out that the time period after 1998 also seems to be more challenging for arbitrage

trading or factor trading, and hence our results can be viewed as conservative lower bounds.

### 3.2 Factor model estimation

As discussed in Section 2.1, we construct the statistical arbitrage portfolios by using the residuals

of a general factor model for the daily excess returns of a collection of stocks. In particular, we

consider the three empirically most successful families of factor models in our implementation.

For each family, we conduct a rolling window estimation to obtain daily residuals out of sample
from 1998 through 2016. This means that the residual composition matrix Φt−1 of equation (1)
depends only on the information up to time t − 1, and hence there is no look-ahead bias in trading

the residuals. The rolling window estimation is necessary because of the time-variation in risk

exposure of individual stocks and the unbalanced nature of a panel of individuals stock returns.

The three classes of factor models consists of pre-speciﬁed factors, latent unconditional factors

and latent conditional factors:

1. Fama-French factors: We consider 1, 3, 5 and 8 factors based on various versions and

extensions of the Fama-French factor models and downloaded from the Kenneth French Data

Library. We consider them as tradeable assets in our universe. Each model includes the

previous one and adds additional characteristic-based risk factors:

(a) K = 1: CAPM model with the excess return of a market factor

(b) K = 3: Fama-French 3 factor model includes a market, size and value factor

(c) K = 5: Fama-French 3 factor model + investment and proﬁtability factors

(d) K = 8: Fama-French 5 factor model + momentum, short-term reversal and long-term

reversal factors.

We estimate the loadings of the individual stock returns daily with a linear regression on

the factors with a rolling window on the previous 60 days and compute the residual for the

current day out-of-sample. This is the same procedure as in Carhart (1997). At each day

we only consider the stocks with no missing observations in the daily returns within the

rolling window, which in any window removes at most 2% of the stocks given our market

capitalization ﬁlter.

13Of all the stocks that have daily returns observed in a the local lockback window of L = 30 days, only 0.1% have
a missing return the next day for the out-of-sample trading, in which case we do not trade this stock. Hence, our
data set of stocks with market capitalization higher than 0.01% of the total market capitalization, has essentially no
missing daily values on a local window for the time period after 1998.

23

2. PCA factors: We consider 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 latent factors, which are estimated daily

on a rolling window. At each time t − 1, we use the last 252 days, or roughly one trading
year, to estimate the correlation matrix from which we extract the PCA factors.14 Then, we
use the last 60 days to estimate the loadings on the latent factors using linear regressions,

and compute residuals for the current day out-of-sample. At each day we only consider the

stocks with no missing observations in the daily returns during the rolling window, which in

any window removes at most 2% of the stocks given our market capitalization ﬁlter.

3. IPCA factors: We consider 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 factors in the Instrumented PCA (IPCA)

model of Kelly et al. (2019). This is a conditional latent factor model, in which the loadings
βt−1 are a linear function of the asset characteristics at time t − 1. As the characteristics
change at most each month, we reestimate the IPCA model on rolling window every year

using the monthly returns and characteristics of the last 240 months. The IPCA provides the

factor weights and loadings for each stock as a function of the stock characteristics. Hence,

we do not need to estimate the loadings for individual stocks with an additional time-series

regression, but use the loading function and the characteristics at time t − 1 to obtain the

out-of-sample residuals at time t. The other details of the estimation process are carried out

in the way outlined in Kelly et al. (2019).

In addition to the factor models above, we also include the excess returns of the individual stocks

without projecting out the factors. This “zero-factor model” simply consists of the original excess

returns of stocks in our universe and is denoted as K = 0. For each factor model, in our empirical

analysis we observe that the cumulative residuals exhibit consistent and relatively regular mean-

reverting behavior. After taking out suﬃciently many factors, the residuals of diﬀerent stocks are

only weakly correlated.

### 3.3 Implementation

Given the daily out-of-sample residuals from 1998 through 2016 we estimate the trading signal

and policy on a rolling window to obtain the out-of-sample returns of the strategy. For each strategy
we calculate the annualized sample mean µ, annualized volatility σ and annualized Sharpe ratio15
SR = µ
σ . The Sharpe ratio represents a risk-adjusted average return. Our main models estimate
In Section 3.5 we
arbitrage strategies to maximize the Sharpe ratio without transaction costs.

also consider a mean-variance objective and in Section 3.10 we include transaction costs in the

estimation and evaluation.

Our strategies trade the residuals of all stocks, which are mapped back into positions of the

original stocks. We use the standard normalization that the absolute values of the individual stock
portfolio weights sums up to one, i.e. we use the normalization (cid:107)ωR
t−1(cid:107)1 = 1. This normalization
implies a leverage constraint as short positions are bounded by one. The trading signal is based

on a local lookback window of L = 30 days. We show in Section 3.9, that the results are robust to

this choice and are very comparable for a lookback window of L = 60 days. Our main results use a

rolling window of 1,000 days to estimate the deep learning models. For computational reasons we

re-estimate the network only every 125 days using the previous 1,000 days. Section 3.9 shows that

our results are robust to this choice. Our main results show the out-of-sample trading performance

from January 2002 to December 2016 as we use the ﬁrst four years to estimate the signal and

allocation function.

The hyperparameters for the deep learning models are based on the validation results summa-

rized in Appendix C.1. Our benchmark model is a 2-layer CNN with D = 8 local convolutional
ﬁlters and local window size of Dsize = 2 days. The transformer has H = 4 attention heads, which
can be interpreted as capturing four diﬀerent global patterns. The results are extremely robust to

the choice of hyperparameters. Appendix B.4 includes all the technical details for implementing

the deep learning models.

### 3.4 Main Results

Table 1 displays the main results for various arbitrage models. It reports the annualized Sharpe

ratio, mean return and volatility for our principal deep trading strategy CNN+Transformer and

the two benchmark models, Fourier+FFN and OU+Threshold, for every factor model described in

Section 3.2. The CNN+Transformer model and Fourier+FFN model are estimated with a Sharpe

ratio objective. We obtain the daily out-of-sample residuals for diﬀerent number of factors K for

the time period January 1998 to December 2016. The daily returns of the out-of-sample arbitrage

trading is then evaluated from January 2002 to December 2016, as we use a rolling window of four

years to estimate the deep learning models.

First, we conﬁrm that it is crucial to apply statistical arbitrage trading to residuals and not

individual stock returns. The stock returns, denoted as the K = 0 model, perform substantially

worse than any type of residual within the same model and factor family. This is not surprising as

residuals for an appropriate factor model are expected to be better described by a model that cap-

tures mean reversion. Importantly, individual stock returns are highly correlated and a substantial
part of the returns is driven by the low dimensional factor component.16 Hence, the complex non-
parametric models are actually not estimated on many weakly dependent residual time-series, but

most time-series have redundant information. In other words, the models are essentially calibrated

on only a few factor time-series, which severely limits the structure that can be estimated. However,

once we extract around K = 5 factors with any of the diﬀerent factor models, the performance

does not substantially increase by adding more factors. This suggests that most of commonality is

explained by a small number of factors.

Second, the CNN+Transformer model strongly dominates the other benchmark models in terms

of Sharpe ratio and average return. The Sharpe ratio is approximately twice as large as for a compa-

16Pelger (2020) shows that around one third of the individual stock returns is explained by a latent four-factor

model.

This table shows the out-of-sample annualized Sharpe ratio (SR), mean return (µ), and volatility (σ) of our three statistical
arbitrage models for diﬀerent numbers of risk factors K, that we use to obtain the residuals. We use the daily out-of-
sample residuals from January 1998 to December 2016 and evaluate the out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to
December 2016. CNN+Trans denotes the convolutional network with transformer model, Fourier+FFN estimates the signal
with a FFT and the policy with a feedforward neural network and lastly, OU+Thres is the parametric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
model with thresholding trading policy. The two deep learning models are calibrated on a rolling window of four years and
use the Sharpe ratio objective function. The signals are extracted from a rolling window of L = 30 days. The K = 0 factor
model corresponds to directly using stock returns instead of residuals for the signal and trading policy.

rable Fourier+FFN model and four times higher for the corresponding parametric OU+Threshold

model. Using IPCA residuals, the CNN+Transformer achieves the impressive out-of-sample Sharpe

ratio of around 4, in spite of trading only the most liquid large cap stocks and the time period after

2002. The mean returns of the CNN+Transformer are similar to the Fourier+FFN model, but

have substantially smaller volatilities, which results in the higher Sharpe ratios. The parametric

mean-reversion model achieves positive mean returns with Sharpe ratios close to one for the IPCA

residuals, but as expected is too restrictive relative to the ﬂexible models. The Fourier+FFN has

the same ﬂexibility as the CNN+Transformer in its allocation function, but is restricted to a pre-

speciﬁed signal structure. The diﬀerence in performance quantiﬁes the importance of extracting

the complex time-series signals.

Third, the average return of the arbitrage strategies is large in spite of the leverage constraints.

selling. The CNN+Transformer with a ﬁve-factor PCA residual achieves an attractive annual

mean return of around 14%. This means that the strategies do not require an infeasible amount of

leverage to yield an average return that might be required by investors. In other words, the high

Sharpe ratios are not the results of vanishing volatility but a combination of high average returns

with moderate volatility.

Fourth, the arbitrage strategies are qualitatively robust to the choice of factor models to obtain

residuals. The Fama-French and PCA factor lead to very similar Sharpe ratio results, suggesting

that they explain a similar amount of co-movement in the data. However, as the mean returns

of PCA factors are usually higher than the mean returns of the Fama-French factors, the risk

factors are diﬀerent. This conﬁrms the ﬁndings of Pelger (2020) and Lettau and Pelger (2020b),

who show that PCA factors do not coincide with Fama-French type factors and explain diﬀerent

mean returns. The IPCA factors use the additional ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristic information. The

resulting residuals achieve the highest Sharpe ratios, which illustrates that conditional factor models

can capture more information than unconditional models. Including the momentum and reversal

factors in the Fama-French 8 factor models to obtain residuals still results in proﬁtable arbitrage

strategies. Hence, the arbitrage strategies are not simply capturing a conventional price trend risk

premium.

The returns of the CNN+Transformer arbitrage strategies are statistically signiﬁcant and not

subsumed by conventional risk factors. Table 2 reports the out-of-sample pricing errors α of the

arbitrage strategies relative of the Fama-French 8 factor model and their mean returns µ. We run a

time-series regression of the out-of-sample returns of the arbitrage strategies on the 8-factor model

(Fama-French 5 factors + momentum + short-term reversal + long-term reversal) and report the
annualized α, accompanying t-statistic value tα, and the R2 of the regression. In addition, we report
the annualized mean return µ along with its accompanying t-statistic tµ. The arbitrage strategies
for the CNN+Transformer model for K ≥ 1 are all statistically signiﬁcant and not explained by the

Fama-French 5 factors or price trend factors. Importantly, the pricing errors are essentially as large

as the mean returns, which implies that the returns of the CNN+Transformer arbitrage strategies
do not carry any risk premium of these eight factors. This is supported by the R2 values, which
are close to zero for the Fama-French or PCA residuals, and hence conﬁrm that these arbitrage

portfolios are essentially orthogonal to the Fama-French 8 factors. In contrast, one third of the

individual return variation for K = 0 is explained by those risk factors. However, even in that case

the pricing errors are signiﬁcant. The residuals of IPCA factors have a higher correlation with the

Fama-French 8 factors, suggesting that the conditional IPCA factor model extracts factors that are

inherently diﬀerent from the conventional risk factors. Note that the residuals of a Fama-French 8

factor model are not mechanically orthogonal in the time-series regression on the Fama-French 8

factors, as we construct out-of-sample residuals based on rolling window estimates. The parametric

arbitrage strategies are largely explained by conventional risk factors. The third subtable in Table

2 shows that the residuals of the OU+Threshold model for Fama-French or PCA residuals do not

have statistically signiﬁcant pricing errors on a 1% level.

This table shows the out-of-sample pricing errors α of the arbitrage strategies relative of the Fama-French 8 factor model and
their mean returns µ for the diﬀerent arbitrage models and diﬀerent number of factors K that we use to obtain the residuals.
We run a time-series regression of the out-of-sample returns of the arbitrage strategies on the 8-factor model (Fama-French
5 factors + momentum + short-term reversal + long-term reversal) and report the annualized α, accompanying t-statistic
value tα, and the R2 of the regression. In addition, we report the annualized mean return µ along with its accompanying
t-statistic tµ. The hypothesis test are two-sided and stars indicate p-values of 5% (∗), 1% (∗∗), and 0.1% (∗∗∗). All results
use the out-of-sample daily returns from January 2002 to December 2016 and the deep learning models are based on a Sharpe
ratio objective.

The CNN+Transformer has a consistent out-of-sample performance and is not aﬀected by vari-

ous negative events. Figure 5 shows the cumulative out-of-sample returns of the arbitrage strategies

for our representative models. We select the residuals of the various ﬁve-factor models as including

additional factors has only minor eﬀects on the performance. Note that the CNN+Transformer

model has consistently almost always positive returns, while maintaining a low volatility and avoid-

ing any large losses. Importantly, the performance of the CNN+Transformer is nearly completely

immune to both the “quant quake” which aﬀected quantitative trading groups and funds engaging

in statistical arbitrage in August 2007 (Barr (2007)), and the period of poor performance in quant

funds during 2011–2012 (Ebrahimi (2013)). The Fourier+FFN model also performs similarly well

until the ﬁnancial crisis, but its risk increases afterwards as displayed by the larger volatility and

These ﬁgures show the cumulative daily returns of the arbitrage strategies for our representative models on the out-of-sample

learning models use the Sharpe ratio objective.

larger drawdowns. The performance of the parametric model is visibly inferior. This illustrates that

although all strategies trade the same residuals, which should be orthogonal to common market

risk, proﬁtable arbitrage trading requires an appropriate signal and allocation policy.

### 3.5 Mean-Variance Objective

The deep learning statistical arbitrage strategies can achieve high average returns in spite of

leverage constraints. Our main deep learning models are estimated with a Sharpe ratio objective.

As the sum of absolute stock weights is normalized to one, the arbitrage strategies impose an

implicit leverage constraint. We show that the average return can be increased while maintaining

this leverage constraint. For this purpose we change the objective for the deep learning model to a

This table shows the out-of-sample annualized Sharpe ratio (SR), mean return (µ), and volatility (σ) of our CNN+Transformer
and Fourier+FFN models for diﬀerent numbers of risk factors K, that we use to obtain the residuals. We use a mean-variance
objective function with risk aversion γ = 1. We use the daily out-of-sample residuals from January 1998 to December 2016
and evaluate the out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to December 2016. The two deep learning models are
calibrated on a rolling window of four years. The signals are extracted from a rolling window of L = 30 days. The K = 0
factor model corresponds to directly using stock returns instead of residuals for the signal and trading policy.

mean-variance objective. In order to illustrate the eﬀect of the diﬀerent objective function, we set

the risk aversion parameter to γ = 1.

Tables 3 and 4 collect the results for the Sharpe ratio, mean, volatility and signiﬁcance tests.

As expected the Sharpe ratios are slightly lower compared to the corresponding model with Sharpe

ratio objective, but the mean returns are substantially increased. The CNN+Transformer model

achieves average annual returns around 20% with PCA and IPCA residuals while the volatility

is only around half as large as the one of a market portfolio. The mean returns are statistically

highly signiﬁcant and not spanned by conventional risk factors or a price trend risk premium.

The Fourier+FFN model can also obtain high average returns, but those come at the cost of

a higher volatility. Overall, we conﬁrm that the more ﬂexible signal extraction function of the

CNN+Transformer is crucial for the superior performance.

### 3.6 Unconditional Residual Means

The unconditional average of residuals is not a proﬁtable strategy and does not provide infor-

mation about the potential arbitrage proﬁtability contained in the residuals. A natural question to

ask is if the residuals themselves have a risk premium component and if trading an equally weighted

This table shows the out-of-sample pricing errors α of the arbitrage strategies relative of the Fama-French 8 factor model and
their mean returns µ for the diﬀerent arbitrage models and diﬀerent number of factors K that we use to obtain the residuals.
We use a mean-variance objective function with risk aversion γ = 1. We run a time-series regression of the out-of-sample
returns of the arbitrage strategies on the 8-factor model (Fama-French 5 factors + momentum + short-term reversal + long-
term reversal) and report the annualized α, accompanying t-statistic value tα, and the R2 of the regression. In addition, we
report the annualized mean return µ along with its accompanying t-statistic tµ. The hypothesis test are two-sided and stars
indicate p-values of 5% (∗), 1% (∗∗), and 0.1% (∗∗∗). All results use the out-of-sample daily returns from January 2002 to
December 2016.

portfolio of residuals could be proﬁtable. Table A.VI in the Appendix shows the performance of

this simple strategy. If we do not project out any factors (K = 0), this strategy essentially trades an

equally weighted market portfolio. Table A.VII in the Appendix reports the test statistics relative

to the Fama-French 8 factor model, which completely subsumes the market risk premium. Once

we regress out at least 3 factors, the equally weighted residuals have a mean return of around 1%

or lower. The low volatility conﬁrms that the residuals are only weakly cross-sectionally dependent

and are largely diversiﬁed away. The moderately large Sharpe ratios for PCA residuals is a conse-

quence of the near zero volatility. Scaling up the mean returns to a meaningful magnitude would

potentially require an unreasonable amount of leverage. Overall, we conﬁrm that residuals need to

be combined with a signal and trading policy that takes advantage of the time series patterns in

order to achieve a proﬁtable strategy.

IPCA factors are close to uncorrelated with conventional risk factors. The R2 values in Table
A.VII are as expected for the Fama-French factors and, not surprisingly, after regressing out all of

those factors, the cross-sectional average of the residuals is essentially orthogonal to those factors.

The PCA residuals show a very similar behavior. However, the conditional IPCA model leaves a

component in the residuals that it is highly correlated with conventional risk factors. In this sense,

the IPCA factors extract a factor model that is quite diﬀerent from the Fama-French factors.

Importantly, unconditional means and alphas of asset pricing residuals are a poor measure of

31

arbitrage opportunities. The mean and alphas of residuals that are optimally traded based on their

time series patterns have mean returns that can be larger by a factor of 50. This implies more

generally, that the unconditional perspective of evaluating asset pricing models could potentially

overstate the eﬃciency of markets and the pricing ability of asset pricing models.

### 3.7 Importance of Time-Series Signal

How important is the ﬂexibility in the signal extraction function relative to the allocation

function? So far, we have considered a rigid parametric model for the signal and allocation function

and a ﬂexible allocation function but either a pre-speciﬁed time-series ﬁlter or a data-driven ﬂexible

ﬁlter. In A.IX in Appendix we also report the results for two additional model variations, which

serve as ablation tests emphasizing the central importance of applying a time-series model to extract

a signal extraction function from the data.

The ﬁrst model, OU+FFN, uses the same 4-dimensional OU signal as the OU+Threshold policy,

but replaces the threshold allocation function with an feedforward neural network (FFN) allocation

function. This FFN allocation function has the same architecture as that of the Fourier+FFN

policy, except the input is 4-dimensional instead of 30-dimensional. The results show that even

despite using a very ﬂexible allocation function, the results are similar or even worse than the

simple parametric thresholding rule. This points to the weakness of the OU signal representation:

although the allocation function is a powerful universal approximator, it cannot accomplish much

with an information-poor input.

If the optimal allocation function given the simple OU signal

is well approximated by the parametric thresholding rule, then the nonparametric FFN oﬀers too

much ﬂexibility without comparable eﬃciency, which leads to a noisier estimate of a simple function

and hence worse out-of-sample performance.

The second model does not extract a time-series signal from the residuals, but uses the residuals

themselves as signal to a ﬂexible FFN allocation function. As the allocation function uses the same

type of network as for the CNN+Transformer, Fourier+FFN or OU+FFN, this setup directly

assesses the relevance of using a time-series model for the signal. The FFN model also performs

worse than the deep learning models that apply a time-series ﬁlter to the residuals. This is a good

example to emphasize the importance of a time-series model. While FFNs are ﬂexible in learning

low dimensional functional relationships, they are limited in learning a complex dependency model

if the training data is limited. For example, the FFN is not suﬃciently eﬃcient to learn an FFT-

like transformation and hence has a substantially worse performance on the original time-series

compared to frequency-transformed time-series.

In summary, the ﬂexible data-driven signal extraction function of the CNN+Transformer model

seems to be the critical element for statistical arbitrage. A ﬂexible allocation function is not
suﬃcient to compensate for an uninformative signal.17

17A natural signal would be the volatility of residuals on the look-back window. The volatility is a speciﬁc
transformation of the time-series of residuals on the look-back window. While more advanced modeling such as
that in Li and Tang (2022) may improve our results, we note that the approximation properties of transformers
are strong enough that they can learn a variety of volatility modeling functions (see e.g. Yun et al. (2019)). We

This table shows the out-of-sample annualized Sharpe ratio (SR), mean return (µ), and volatility (σ) of the CNN+Transformer
model for diﬀerent numbers of risk factors K, that we use to obtain the residuals. The signals are extracted from a rolling
window of L = 60 days. We use the daily out-of-sample residuals from January 1998 to December 2016 and evaluate the
out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to December 2016. The model is calibrated on a rolling window of four
years and uses the Sharpe ratio objective function. The K = 0 factor model corresponds to directly using stock returns instead
of residuals for the signal and trading policy.

### 3.8 Dependency between Arbitrage Strategies

The trading strategies for diﬀerent factor models are only weakly correlated. In Table A.VIII,

we report the correlations of the returns of our CNN+Transformer strategies across factor models
with 3, 5, and 10 factors, based on the Sharpe ratio objective function strategy.18 Notably, the
correlations between strategies from diﬀerent factor model families range from roughly 0.2 to 0.45,

indicating that strategies for diﬀerent factor model families can be used as part of a diversiﬁcation

strategy. While the performance of the arbitrage trading for the residuals obtained with diﬀerent

families of factor models is comparable, the factors themselves are diﬀerent. Hence, even if the

arbitrage signal and allocation functions are similar, the resulting strategies can be weakly corre-

lated. The within-family correlations range from 0.4 to 0.85, indicating that the residuals from the
same class of factor model capture similar patterns.19

### 3.9 Stability over Time

Our results are robust to length of the local window to extract the trading signal. We re-

estimate the CNN+Transformer model on an extended rolling lookback window of L = 60 days,

while keeping the rest of the model structure the same. Tables 5 and 6 show that the results are

robust to the choice of lookback window. Extending the local window to 60 trading days, which

is close to three months, leads to essentially the same performance as using only the most recent

have veriﬁed empirically that including the volatility directly as an additional signal parameter does not lead to an
improved performance.

18The correlations for the mean-variance objective function are similar.
19We conﬁrm the possible diversiﬁcation beneﬁts of combining arbitrage strategies from diﬀerent factor families
with ﬁve factors. We consider the three statistical arbitrage strategies from the FF-5, PCA-5 and IPCA-5 residuals
and combine them in a mean-variance eﬃcient portfolio. The resulting portfolio weights are approximately 0.7, 0.15,
and 0.15 for IPCA-5, PCA-5 and FF-5 residuals respectively, illustrating how the PCA5 and FF5 strategies can
contribute by hedging the performance of the IPCA5 strategy. This mean-variance eﬃcient portfolio strategy attains
an annualized Sharpe ratio of 4.52.

This table shows the out-of-sample pricing errors α of the arbitrage strategies relative of the Fama-French 8 factor model and
their mean returns µ for the CNN+Transformer model and diﬀerent number of factors K that we use to obtain the residuals.
The signals are extracted from a rolling window of L = 60 days. We run a time-series regression of the out-of-sample returns
of the arbitrage strategies on the 8-factor model (Fama-French 5 factors + momentum + short-term reversal + long-term
reversal) and report the annualized α, accompanying t-statistic value tα, and the R2 of the regression. In addition, we report
the annualized mean return µ along with its accompanying t-statistic tµ. The hypothesis test are two-sided and stars indicate
p-values of 5% (∗), 1% (∗∗), and 0.1% (∗∗∗). All results use the out-of-sample daily returns from January 2002 to December
2016 and are based on a Sharpe ratio objective.

L = 30 trading days to infer the signal. This is further evidence that the arbitrage signal is diﬀerent

from conventional momentum or reversal strategies that incorporate information from longer time

periods. As the signal can be inferred from the most recent past, it implies that either the arbitrage

signal depends only on the most recent days or that those days are suﬃcient to infer the relevant

time-series structure. In the next section, we provide evidence that the arbitrage trading signals

put strong emphasis on most recent two weeks prior to the trading.

A constant-in-time signal and allocation function captures a large fraction of the arbitrage infor-

mation. We re-estimate the CNN+Transformer model with a constant model instead of the rolling

window calibration. Our main models are estimated on a rolling window of four years, which allows
the models to adopt to changing economic conditions. Here we use either the ﬁrst Ttrain = 4 years
(1,000 trading days) or Ttrain = 8 years (2,000 trading days) to estimate the signal and allocation
function, and then keep those functions constant for the remaining out-of-sample trading period.

The results are reported in Tables 7 and 8. As expected the performance decreases relative to a

time-varying model with re-estimation, which suggests that there is some degree of time-variation

in the signal and allocation function. The longer training window of 8 years results in slightly higher

Sharpe ratios than the 4 year window, as the model has more data and more variety in the market

environment to learn the arbitrage information. Importantly, the constant CNN+Transformer still

substantially outperforms the other benchmark models, Fourier+FFN and OU+Threshold, even

if those are estimated on a rolling window. We conclude that the constant signal and allocation

function for the CNN+Transformer model already capture a substantial amount of statistical ar-

bitrage information. Therefore, the constant functions serve as a meaningful model to analyze in

more detail in Section 3.15.

This table shows the out-of-sample annualized Sharpe ratio (SR), mean return (µ), and volatility (σ) of the CNN+Transformer
model for diﬀerent numbers of risk factors K. We estimate the model on only once on the ﬁrst Ttrain days and keep it constant
on the remaining test set. We use the daily out-of-sample residuals from January 1998 to December 2016 and evaluate the
out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 1998 +Ttrain to December 2016. The signals are extracted from a rolling window
of L = 30 days and we use the Sharpe ratio objective function.

### 3.10 Market Frictions and Transaction Costs

Our deep learning arbitrage strategies remain proﬁtable in the presence of realistic trading

frictions. In practice, trading costs associated with high turnover or large short-selling positions

can diminish the proﬁtability of arbitrage trading. In order to ensure that our model produces

economically meaningful results, we extend it to the setting in which both transaction costs and

holding costs are accounted for. We do not model market frictions associated with market impact,

as in our empirical analysis we restrict the asset universe to stocks with large market capitalization,

which are especially liquid.

In our market-friction extension, the daily returns Rt of the strategy now have constant linear
penalties associated with the daily turnover and the proportion of short trades. These penalties

quantify proportional transaction costs, which are used to model trading fees, size of the bid-ask

spread, etc., and holding costs, which are used to model short borrow rate fees charged by a

brokerage. In particular, we incorporate a subset of the market friction models proposed by Boyd
et al. (2017), which are commonly used in the statistical arbitrage literature.20 Mathematically, we

Appendix in Table A.X with very similar ﬁndings. We exclude the Fama-French factor model from

the analysis with market frictions, as we take the traded factors from Kenneth French Data Library

as given, which are based on a larger stock universe with diﬀerent trading costs and, hence, would
not be directly comparable to the IPCA and PCA results.23 As expected the Sharpe ratios are lower
and range from 0.94 to 1.24 for a reasonable number of IPCA factors. The Sharpe ratio and mean-

variance objective have the desired eﬀects, but lead to overall very similar results. Importantly, the

arbitrage strategies retain their economic signiﬁcance even in the presence of trading costs.

23Regardless, each factor corresponds to a portfolio of traded assets, and thus the residuals of this model could
be traded in a number of a number of ways under suitable extensions. For example, we could include ETFs which
try to track a value or size premium, project these latent factors onto our asset universe, or approximate each factor
with a number of sparse subset of assets in our asset universe as in Pelger and Xiong (2022). However, these changes
constitute diﬀerences that would make the results incomparable to the PCA and IPCA results.

These ﬁgures show the daily fraction of short trades of the CNN+Transformer strategies with and without trading friction

t−1, 0)(cid:107)L1 relative to the sum of
absolute values of all weights, which is normalized to (cid:107)wR
t−1(cid:107)1 = 1. The models are calibrated on a rolling window of four
years and use the Sharpe ratio objective function with or without trading costs (cost(wR

These results present a lower bound on the proﬁtability under trading frictions, as we have

made four simplifying assumptions. First, in the current implementation the factor composition

cannot be changed due to trading costs. A possible extension could construct the latent risk

factors by including the trading friction objective. For example, the sparse representation of latent

factors as in Pelger and Xiong (2022) would reduce trading costs. Second, because the policy with

frictions is recursive, we are conducting an approximate training process to maintain parallelization

given our computational resources and the large volume of data, but this may lead to suboptimal

optimization results. However, it would be possible to conduct an exact sequential training process

at the cost of more computation. Third, our modiﬁed architecture with the market-friction objective

is given by the simplest modiﬁcation to our architecture without frictions, but it is possible that

the optimal transaction and holding cost-minimizing strategy has a more complicated functional

form or is not Markovian and requires additional previous allocations. Last but not least, we keep

the hyperparameters of our main analysis, but we could potentially improve the performance by

employing hyperparameter tuning.

The eﬀect of trading frictions is time-varying and our model can exploit particularly proﬁtable

arbitrage time periods by increasing trading and short positions. In Figure 6 we analyze the daily

turnover of a representative CNN+Transformer strategy based on IPCA 5-factor residuals and

a Sharpe ratio objective. Broadly, we see that our model with trading friction penalty is able

to adapt by decreasing daily turnover. However, our model seems to reduce turnover based on

trading opportunities. During the times of high market volatility such as 2007–2009, arbitrage

trading could be potentially be more proﬁtable, which our model takes advantage of. On the

other hand, during the later years of the calm bull market from 2011–2015, strategies with less

turnover could maintain proﬁtability. This pattern is conﬁrmed in Figure 7 which shows the daily

proportion of allocation weights, which are short stocks in our universe. As expected the holding

cost friction model reduces the overall proportion of short trades. Interestingly, our model is able

to intelligently choose time periods during which it can maximize performance by taking positions

with higher short proportion, such as the market turmoil at the end of 2015 and the ﬁnancial crisis

of 2008. Eﬀectively, this indicates that the CNN+Transformer trading policy has learned to avoid

holding and transaction costs by generally modifying the original strategy’s allocations to be less

short-biased on average, and to more appropriately enter short-dominant positions during relevant

subperiods.

### 3.11 Portfolio Weight Concentration

In this section we study the portfolio weight concentration of successful statistical arbitrage

trading. We show that our arbitrage portfolios are well-diversiﬁed, but we can still achieve a large

fraction of the proﬁtability when restricted to a sparse set of assets.

In this and the following

sections, the benchmark model is the CNN+Transformer based on IPCA 5-factor residuals and

a Sharpe ratio objective. The results hold qualitatively for alternative factor speciﬁcations. We
study the out-of-sample portfolio weights wR
t

for individual stocks.

Figure 8 shows that the optimal portfolio weights are well-diversiﬁed and do not rely on exces-

sively large weights on individual stocks. The left subplot shows the histogram of the distribution
of stock weights wR
t aggregated over time. The weights are approximately normally distributed
and centered at zero. Hence, most weights concentrate around values in [−0.5%, +0.5%], which

implies a relatively well-diversiﬁed portfolio. Second, the portfolios correspond to long-short posi-

tions with approximately similar weights on each of the two legs. The right subplot estimates the

baseline model with the trading friction penalty from Section 3.10. While a trading friction penalty

increases the kurtosis, which implies sparser weights, we still do not observe excessive weights on

for trading, while panel B selects the proportion p of the most extreme residual weights w(cid:15)

individual stocks. The trading friction penalty also reduces short sales, which is consistent with

Figure 7.

Our statistical arbitrage trading policy does not target speciﬁc industries. Figure A.5 in the

Appendix shows the rolling industry concentration of portfolio weights standardized by the popu-

lation industry concentration. The fraction invested in a speciﬁc industry follows very closely the

sample proportion of stocks in the corresponding industry. While there is some minor variation in

the industry concentration over time, it deviates less than 20% from the population concentration.

This suggests that stocks in all industries oﬀer statistical arbitrage opportunities.

While our statistical arbitrage portfolios are well-diversiﬁed, a subset of a few stocks can already

achieve most of their performance. This ﬁnding is important for optimization under trading fric-

tions. We construct sparse trading policies by selecting only the proportion p of the stock weights
wR
t with the largest absolute value for trading. We compare the full model with sparse models,
which invest only in p = 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the stocks. Note that this represents only a lower

bound for the performance of sparse portfolios, as we are not including the sparsity constraint in

the optimization.

Figure 9 in panel A shows the annualized out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, mean return and volatility

of arbitrage strategies based only the most extreme portfolio weights. Portfolios with less stocks

are less diversiﬁed and as expected have a higher volatility. However, focussing on the extreme

weights can increase the mean return of the portfolios. The Sharpe ratio of sparse portfolios is

generally decreasing in the degree of sparsity, as the loss in diversiﬁcation dominates the eﬀect

of higher expected returns. However, a sparse portfolio can capture a substantial amount of the

proﬁtability. We achieve out-of-sample Sharpe ratios above two with only 10% of the stocks. These

are lower bounds as we use the model that is optimized for non-sparse weights, and select only the

extreme weights. It is noteworthy, that using only 5% of the stocks, which corresponds to roughly

25 stocks in our sample, achieves mean returns of 14%. However, the performance deteriorates

when our portfolio consists of only 1%, corresponding to around 5 stocks. The cumulative return

time series in Figure 10 further illustrate the diﬀerent eﬀect of sparsity on the mean and variance

of the strategies.

In our second analysis, we construct sparse residual portfolio weights w(cid:15)

t . Similar to the sparse
stock weights, we select the proportion p of the most extreme residual weights w(cid:15)
t for the trading
policy. A sparse stock portfolio weight wR
t combines a sparse factor representation and a sparse
trading policy in residuals. By studying the largest portfolio weights in residuals, we can separate

the eﬀect of sparse factors from a sparse trading policy in residuals. This is relevant as some factors

could be approximated by a sparse set of traded assets, for example ETFs. Panel B in Figure 9 shows
the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, mean return and volatility for sparse residual portfolio weights w(cid:15)
t .
The Sharpe ratio eﬀects are very similar, as targeting the most extreme residual portfolios results

in larger mean returns, while it increases the variance. However, a sparse residual portfolio can

achieve around twice the expected return of a sparse stock portfolio.

### 3.12 Complexity of Arbitrage Trading

Our CNN+Transformer solution can discover complex trading signals and policies. As a ro-

bustness check, we study how much simple reversal strategies can earn. Given the residuals from

our baseline IPCA-5-factor model, we construct long-short trading strategies for diﬀerent time

lags. Such high-minus-low strategies have been motivated in He et al. (2022). In more detail, the

portfolio weights of the simple trading strategy are long-short portfolios, that buy the 20% lowest

residuals and sell the 20% highest residuals from L periods in the past.

Figure 11 shows the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, mean return and volatility of simple reversal

strategies. First, these simple reversal strategies yield positive returns and Sharpe ratios. The

variance is increasing for longer lags. The reversal returns increase substantially with a lag of at

least one week (ﬁve trading days). The Sharpe ratios are primarily driven by the low variance and

achieve Sharpe ratios of up to 0.3 for lags between one and two weeks.

Simple reversal strategies result in substantially lower mean returns and Sharpe ratios than our

complex arbitrage strategies. This conﬁrms that simple ad-hoc approaches are not suﬃcient to

leverage mispricing and successful arbitrage trading is more complex than simple reversal patterns.

The ﬁndings also suggest that there is proﬁtability in longer holding periods for signals that are

further in the past. We will study this aspect in depth in the next section.

### 3.13 Persistence of Arbitrage

We study arbitrage trading for diﬀerent holding periods and show that statistical arbitrage sig-
nals are persistent over short horizons. Given the out-of-sample portfolio weights wR
t , we document
the portfolio performance for longer holding periods. As in the previous sections, our benchmark

model is the CNN+Transformer based on IPCA 5-factor residuals and a Sharpe ratio objective.

First, we consider longer holding periods, that can overlap. An investment with weights wR
t
is held for B trading days, ranging from 1 to 30 trading days. The trading with longer holding

periods is overlapping and the fraction 1/B is invested based on new weights every trading day.

These ﬁgures show the annualized out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, mean return and volatility of simple reversal strategies based

lowest residuals and sell the 20% highest residuals for L periods in the past. The out-of-sample trading period is between
January 2002 and December 2016.

Panel A in Figure 12 shows the annualized out-of-sample Sharpe ratio, mean return and volatil-

ity for diﬀerent overlapping holding periods. Daily trading indeed generates the highest payoﬀ in

terms of mean returns and Sharpe ratios. The half-life in terms of Sharpe ratios is around seven

trading days.

In fact, the Sharpe ratio is still above one with a one month (22 business days)

holding period, when using signals estimated with a 1-day trading objective. As expected, the

lower trading frequency can reduce the volatility. This shows that statistical arbitrage can persists

for several days and even weeks. We also include the results, when we change the estimation to

optimize the Sharpe ratio of the overlapping multi-horizon holding periods. It is possible to achieve

out-of-sample Sharpe ratios of around 1.5 with a one month holding period, when directly opti-

mizing for longer holding periods. The mean returns for a strategy based on the B-day trading

objective decline less than for a 1-day trading objective. For longer horizons this comes at the cost

of a slightly higher variance. For shorter horizons, the B-day trading objective reduces the variance

by taking advantage of additional diversiﬁcation.

Overlapping trading generates diversiﬁcation eﬀects between strategies. It is a valid measure

of how fast signals are dying out, but it is still implicitly based on daily trading. Optimizing for a

longer holding period can take advantage of this diversiﬁcation eﬀects and increase the mean return

without strongly increasing the variance. This is one reason why we can maintain Sharpe ratios of

1.5 for one month holding periods.

An alternative analysis actually trades only every B days without overlap. As there are B

diﬀerent starting days, this yields B possible implementations of a B-day holding strategy. We

report the average performance for each of the possible B starting days, that is, we average the

performance metrics, but do not create a portfolio of overlapping returns. Panel B in Figure 12

shows the corresponding results. By construction, the mean returns for weights based on the 1-day

trading objective are identical to overlapping trading. The diﬀerence between the two analyses

comes from the variance. The overlapping trading generates large diversiﬁcation beneﬁts, which

are not achieved with the separate non-overlapping trading. As a result the Sharpe ratios for non-

overlapping trading are lower. However, even with a one month (22 business days) holding period,

we still achieve an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of around 0.5. There is little improvement when

optimizing the trading for a longer holding period with non-overlapping trading.

Overall, we have two main ﬁndings. First, arbitrageurs do indeed correct prices quickly. Depend-

ing on the analysis around half of the Sharpe ratio vanishes after one or two weeks. Arbitrageurs

do engage in arbitrage trading as signals do eventually die out over longer horizons. Second, the

statistical arbitrage signals seem to be persistent over short horizons of one week. The persistence

in arbitrage signals over shorter horizons could be explained by the limited capacity of arbitrageurs,

that is, arbitrageurs might have insuﬃcient capital to fully exploit temporal mispricing quickly. An

based on new weights every trading day. In panel B, we estimate for a holding period of B days, the performance of the
B diﬀerent trading strategies starting at diﬀerent days and report the average results. Hence, panel B reports results for
non-overlapping portfolios. The out-of-sample trading period is between January 2002 and December 2016.

alternative explanation could relate to strategic trading. Arbitrageurs might try to take advan-

tage of temporal mispricing, while at the same time limit their market impact to avoid revealing

their detected signal. A third explanation could relate to behavioral trading. In the presence of

noise traders or uninformed traders, the adjustment of prices also depends on how quickly the

non-arbitrageurs adjust their expectations. The short-term persistence of arbitrage has also prac-

tical implications. It explains our ﬁndings from Section 3.10, why statistical arbitrage can also be

exploited in the presence of transaction costs by avoiding frequent trading.

### 3.14 Arbitrage vs. Risk Premium Component

Stochastic discount factor (SDF) modeling and statistical arbitrage modeling are conceptually

diﬀerent but complimentary problems. A model for the SDF captures the risk premium of assets,

and the resulting SDF portfolio earns the compensation for risk. Statistical arbitrage investing

can try to exploit temporal ﬂuctuations around the risk premium. We can in principal use any

44

Figure 13: Arbitrage vs. Risk Premium Component

The left ﬁgure shows the cumulative out-of-sample returns of the statistical arbitrage strategy and the SDF implied by IPCA-5
factors. The statistical arbitrage strategy uses the CNN+Transformer model on IPCA-5 residuals. The SDF returns are the
based on the out-of-sample mean-variance eﬃcient factor portfolio on a rolling window of the prior 20 years. The SDF portfolio
is leveraged to have the same end-of-period value as the statistical arbitrage strategy. The right ﬁgure shows the cumulative
returns of stocks and their systematic component for a representative example. The systematic component is the return
implied by the IPCA-5 factor model. The diﬀerence between the stock return and the systematic component corresponds to
the residual. The temporal deviations from the model implied cumulative return follow systematic patterns, which can be
exploited by statistical arbitrage.

asset pricing model to construct the stock-mimicking benchmark portfolios, and then exploit the

temporal ﬂuctuations with our statistical arbitrage model.

In our paper we focus on arguably

some of the most widely used asset pricing models to construct the stock-mimicking benchmark

portfolios.

We illustrate this point with our IPCA-5 benchmark model. Figure 13(b) shows the cumulative

stock returns for a representative stock. The blue line is the systematic component implied by

the factor model, which corresponds to the stock-mimicking benchmark. The diﬀerence between

the return of the stock-mimicking benchmark portfolio and the stock return itself is the residual

return. For this example, the cumulative residual returns seem to be a mean-reverting process

around the systemic component implied by the IPCA-5 factor model. The main point is that there

is predictable structure in this short-term mean reverting patterns, and a sophisticated time-series

model like our CNN+Transformer can detect and exploit these time-series patterns.

Note that the systematic component earns a risk premium, which can be exploited by forming

an optimal portfolio based on the factors themselves. Statistical arbitrage is not trying to earn the

risk premium component, but the temporal deviations around it. As we discuss next, an investor

can combine statistical arbitrage trading with optimal factor investing.

An investor can combine investment strategies that earn a risk premium and that exploit tem-

poral price deviations. For a given asset pricing model, our statistical arbitrage model can construct

a trading strategy that exploits relative price movements, which are orthogonal to this asset pricing

45

model. Hence, an investor can earn the risk premium implied by the asset pricing model and in

addition the payoﬀ of the relative ﬂuctuations captured by statistical arbitrage. We illustrate this

point with our IPCA-5 benchmark model. Figure 13(a) shows the cumulative returns of the SDF

implied by the ﬁve IPCA factors and cumulative returns of the CNN+Transformer strategy. The

implied SDF portfolio is the mean-variance eﬃcient combination of the ﬁve IPCA factors (see Let-

tau and Pelger (2020b) or Chen et al. (2022) for more details.) This plot illustrates that a portfolio,

that earns a risk premium, has very diﬀerent returns from the statistical arbitrage portfolio.

An investor, who wants to be exposed to systematic risk, can leverage both portfolios. The

out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of the mean-variance eﬃcient combination of the ﬁve IPCA factors is
SRIPCA = 1.23.24 The out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of the CNN+Transformer statistical arbitrage
trading on the IPCA-5 residuals equals SRarbitrage = 4.16. The IPCA-5 factor portfolio is essentially
uncorrelated with the arbitrage portfolio as it is based on completely diﬀerent signals. This is
conﬁrmed by the low R2 = 0.02, that is obtained by a regression of the arbitrage strategy on the
IPCA-5 factors. Hence, an investor can beneﬁt from the diversiﬁcation of combining both portfolios.

These results also clarify that statistical arbitrage trading is fundamentally diﬀerent from earning

a risk premium.

Explaining risk premia requires diﬀerent models than capturing temporal deviations. The SDF

captures systematic risk and SDF modeling is by construction linked to covariances with systematic

risk. A tradeable SDF portfolio can be obtained by a projection of the SDF on the space of

individual stock returns, which captures the systematic components of returns that are correlated

with the SDF. Most reduced form asset pricing models are conditional SDF models, where the

conditional SDF is constructed by its projection on the space of individual stock returns given a

set of lagged ﬁrm characteristics. This means that the portfolio weights of the SDF are (potentially
complex) functions of a vector of cross-sectional signals (ﬁrm characteristics) from last period.25
In contrast, the statistical arbitrage signal construction is at its core a time-series problem, where

we learn temporal patterns. The diﬀerence between cross-sectional asset pricing and time-series

modeling is reﬂected in the diﬀerent information sets. Cross-sectional asset pricing models usually

use a given (potentially high-dimensional) set of cross-sectional characteristics from the last period

as input, while our statistical arbitrage model learns time-series patterns from a panel of time-series,

which are close to uncorrelated and orthogonal to systematic sources of risk.

It is helpful to relate statistical arbitrage to the usual notion of “alpha” in the asset pricing

literature. In most empirical asset pricing papers, the discussion about alphas refers to the uncon-

ditional time-series mean of residuals from a candidate asset pricing model (which in the case of

factor models are usually obtained either from time-series or cross-sectional regressions). If test

24We form the out-of-sample mean-variance eﬃcient factor portfolios on a rolling window of the prior 20 years.
The results are robust to using diﬀerent rolling window sizes. Note that our analysis only uses the most liquid and
largest stocks and this is why the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio is lower than the one using all stocks as in Kelly et al.
(2019). By including all stocks, we can also replicate their results.

25This is equivalent to modeling conditional ﬁrst and second moments of stock returns given the set of characteristics
to construct a conditional mean-variance eﬃcient portfolio, as discussed among others in Bryzgalova et al. (2023)
and Chen et al. (2022).

46

assets have non-zero unconditional alphas (that is, residuals have time-series means diﬀerent from

zero), then there is an arbitrage opportunity relative to the selected asset pricing model (where

the notation of arbitrage is always in conjunction with a selected model for risk). The key idea

of statistical arbitrage is to exploit predictable patterns in residual time-series with a particular

focus on mean-reversion patterns. A mean-stationary process is expected to mean-revert after large

deviations from its unconditional mean. Our residual portfolios are projections on the return space

that annihilate systematic risk based on the candidate asset pricing model. An extreme case would

be that all residual portfolios have time-series means of zeros. This would represent the particu-

lar case of potentially mean-stationary processes with zero means, and statistical arbitrage could

exploit the temporal patterns for deviating from this particular long-term mean. By doing this,

statistical arbitrage can construct new time-series signals that can lead to conditional alphas based
on those time-series signals.26

Importantly, our statistical arbitrage approach does not require a “perfect” asset pricing model

with zero unconditional alphas. Statistical arbitrage can exploit time-series patterns in residual

returns even when the residual mean is diﬀerent from zero, that is, when there are non-zero un-

conditional alphas. Residuals with non-zero means imply cumulative residual returns with a trend,

which empirically often have mean-reversion patterns around this trend. This results in two types of

potential predictable patterns, namely monotonic trends and predictable ﬂuctuations around them.

Table 1 provides further insights. Even a one-factor model with a market factor, corresponding to

K = 1 for the diﬀerent factor speciﬁcations, can lead to proﬁtable statistical arbitrage trading based

on residual return time-series patterns. In this case, the model is exploiting time-series patterns

that are diﬀerent from market movements. Adding more factors leads to “better” stock mimicking

benchmarks. We do not require that, for example, a K = 5 factor model leads to unconditional

means of residuals that are zero for the full cross-section. The ﬁnding is rather that the cumulative

residual returns from the ﬁve-factor models behave very much like mean-stationary processes (with

potential trends), and these time-series patterns are predictable and can be learned by our model.

The temporal patterns that are exploited by statistical arbitrage impact its interpretation.

Temporal mispricing and its correction by arbitrageurs can be interpreted as incorporating new in-

formation into prices. This would be diﬀerent from a systematic mispricing that persists over longer

time horizons. Temporal mispricing can be related to mean-reversion patterns in cumulative resid-

ual returns. If the arrival of new fundamental information aﬀects the factors in the stock mimicking

portfolio, it is possible that the prices of some individual stocks adjust with some delay, that is, the

diﬀerence between the stock mimicking portfolios and the stocks temporarily widens. Arbitrageurs

can identify this form of mispricing, and by exploiting it, they lead to a price adjustment. Hence,

26Statistical arbitrage maps into conditional alphas, that is non-zero means of a portfolio of residual returns
conditional on price based signals. A time-series pattern in residuals that captures some form of reversal can be used
to construct a reversal managed portfolio with a time-series mean that is diﬀerent from zero and is uncorrelated with
a candidate asset pricing model. Hence, this leads to the construction of a new (conditionally managed) test asset
that has an unconditional alpha with respect to a candidate asset pricing model. This is exactly what we do with
our statistical arbitrage strategy, which is a managed portfolio based on price based signals, and which is orthogonal
to common sources of risk.

47

we would expect a large fraction of the temporal mispricing to disappear over longer time horizons.

Indeed, Section 3.13 conﬁrms that the proﬁtability of statistical arbitrage drops fairly quickly over

longer horizons, which would be consistent with mean-reversion patterns in residuals. A persistent

mispricing in residuals over longer time horizons can be related to unconditional non-zero alphas,

which corresponds to long-term trends in cumulative residual time-series. As only a small fraction

of the proﬁtability of the arbitrage portfolios persists over longer horizon, it seems that temporal

mispricing is the driving force behind statistical arbitrage.

### 3.15 Estimated Structure

What are the patterns that our CNN+Transformer model can learn and exploit? In order

to answer this question, we analyze the diﬀerent building blocks of our benchmark model and

show their structure on representative and informative residuals inputs. Our goal is to ascertain,

characterize, and explain the role that the convolutional features and attention heads play in the

determination of the ﬁnal allocation weight and recognition of salient time series patterns. The

benchmark model for this section is the CNN+Transformer based on IPCA 5-factor residuals and

a Sharpe ratio objective. The model is calibrated on the ﬁrst 8 years of data and kept constant,

which allows us to study the signal and allocation function.

As an illustrative example, Figure 14 shows the allocation and return on representative residuals.

The left subplot displays an out-of-sample time-series of cumulative returns of a randomly selected

residual and its value in the allocation function. We normalize the allocation weight to have an

absolute value of one, that is, for this illustrative example we only trade this particular residual.

The right subplots depicts the payoﬀ of trading the speciﬁc residual with the displayed allocation

function. The ﬁrst residual shows mean-reversion patterns, which are successfully detected and
exploited by the function w(cid:15)|CNN+Trans. The second residual has a downward trend, which is
also correctly detected and taken advantage of by the model.27 These examples suggest that the
CNN+Transformer model can learn mean-reversion and trend patterns. Figures A.2 and A.3 are

further examples with the same takeaways.

Next, we “dissect” the CNN+Transformer model to understand what type of functions it can

estimate. Our analysis begins with the eight basic convolutional patterns learned by the convo-

lutional layers of our network, which are displayed in Figure 15. The CNN represents a given

time-series as a matrix of exposures to local basic patterns. As explained in Section 2.4.3, these

local ﬁlters are more complicated than simple local linear ﬁlters, but we can project our CNN ﬁlters

into two-dimensional orthogonal linear ﬁlters, which are more interpretable. These local patterns

are the building blocks to construct global patterns. We see that these basic patterns display a

variety of salient price behavior which are considered to be important. Basic patterns 4 and 6

capture local upward trends, basic patterns 3 and 7 track local downward trends and basic pat-

terns 1, 5 and 8 learn reversion patterns. However, the basis patterns do not include very spiked,

27Note that our in our empirical study the model trades in all residuals and is not limited to trade only in one

residual. Hence, the empirical performance is substantially better as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 14: Examples of Allocation and Returns of CNN+Transformer Strategy

These plots display representative examples of the CNN+Transformer out-of-sample arbitrage trading on a sample of residuals
from the IPCA 5-factor model. The left subplots show the normalized cumulative returns of the residuals and the normalized
allocation weight, which the speciﬁc residual has in the trading strategy. The right subplots illustrates the payoﬀ of trading

constant.

sharp changes. Overall, the building blocks seem to be suﬃcient to construct any smooth trend

and mean-reversion pattern.

We can understand the global patterns learned by the transformer by studying the attention
function. The attention functions αi(., .) of each attention head i = 1, ..., H = 4 capture the
dependencies between the local patterns. Our arbitrage signal can be interpreted as “loadings” to

these “attention factors”. We use the same H attention functions for all residuals, but in order to

visualize them, we evaluate them for a given residual time-series, which yield the attention weights

per head:

αi,j = αi (˜xL, ˜xj)

for i = 1, ..., H.

As our signal only depends on the ﬁnal cumulative return projection hproj
L , the attention weights
αi,j for i = 1, .., H and j = 1, ..., L contain all the “global factor” information. Hence, we will
plot the H × L dimensional attention weights of the attention heads to understand which global

patterns are activated by speciﬁc time-series.

Figure 16 plots the attention head weights for simulated sinusoidal residual input time-series.

Note that the attention head weights discover the sinusoidal pattern although the model was es-

timated on the empirical data and not speciﬁcally trained for this simulated input. The diﬀerent

attention heads capture diﬀerent patterns. The fourth attention head displayed in red has the

strongest activation and captures high-frequency mean reversion patterns. These attention head

weights are positive for negative realizations. We will label these fourth attention head weights a

“negative reversal” pattern. The third attention head weights depicted by the green curve co-move

with the mean-reversion patterns of the original time-series, that is they are positive for high values,

but seem to be only activated if this positive “hilltop” appears at the beginning of the time-series.

If the mean-reversion cycle achieves its positive values at the end, the third attention head is not

activated. We will label these third attention head weights the “early reversal” pattern. The ﬁrst

attention head in blue seems to be a “dampened” version of the fourth red attention head. Figure

A.4 in the Appendix shows additional simulated input time-series that conﬁrm this interpretation.

In summary, the diﬀerent attention head weights can be assigned to speciﬁc global patterns.

In Figure 17, we plot the diﬀerent components of the CNN+Transformer model evaluated on a

randomly selected, representative 30-day empirical residual. The cumulative residual in subﬁgure

(a) is the input to the CNN. This L = 30 dimensional vector is represented by the CNN in terms

of its “exposure” to local basic pattern. The subﬁgures (d)–(k) show this D × L dimensional

representation, which is the output of the CNN. As we have D = 8 local ﬁlters, we obtain eight

time-series that display the activation to each ﬁlter. For example, basic pattern 1 is associated with

a “reversal kink” in subﬁgure 15(a) and hence has the strongest activation to this basic pattern

on day 28, when the residual has a downward spike. This D × L matrix of exposures to local

patterns is the input to the transformer. The attention head weights in subﬁgure (b) connect

the local patterns to a global pattern. The fourth attention head weight in red has its highest

values during the “bottom” of the residual movements, conﬁrming our previous intuition that this

attention head activates during bad times. The third attention head weight in green spikes during

the “top” at the beginning of the residual time-series, which is in line with our interpretation as an

early reversal pattern. The ﬁrst attention head in blue is a dampened version of the red attention

head. The average over the four attention head weights depicted in subﬁgure (c) suggests that the

heads attend on average more closely to the latter half of the time series.

In Figure 18 we generalize the analysis of Figure 17 to study the model structure of the bench-

mark model over time. While Figure 17 represents a “snapshot” for one point in time, we now

display the allocation weights and attention head weights of a single representative residual for

diﬀerent times. Subﬁgure 18(a) shows the cumulative residual time-series. For a speciﬁc point in

time we use the lagged L = 30 days as an input to obtain the allocation weights and attention

head weights for that time. The out-of-sample allocation weights correctly change the directions

to exploit the patterns in the residual time-series. The attention head weights over time oﬀer ad-

ditional insights into the structure of the global patterns. Each vertical slice from window index 1

to window index 30 displays the normalized attention weights for the time point under the slice.

The third attention head, which was displayed in green in Figures 16 and 17 has the largest val-

ues during “up-patterns” of the residual, for example for 2007, 2010 and 2012. Importantly, the

attention weights focus on the early days within the 30-day window. This conﬁrms our previous

interpretation as an “early reversal” pattern. Attention head four, which was previously repre-

sented as a red line, has the highest values during down-times, such as 2009, 2014 and the middle

of 2016. In contrast to attention head 3, this head focuses on the immediate past within the local

window. Attention head 1, which is a dampened down-version, focuses more uniformly on all the

values within the local window.

The average attention weights in (b) illustrate the asymmetric response of the transformer net-

work. During uptrends, it focuses on the residual prices which are further in the past part of the

window to decide which to position to take; however, during downtrends, it focuses on the most re-

cent cumulative residual prices in the lookback window, which indicates that it is taking into account

the latest data in order to decide what position to take. This indicates that our CNN+Transformer

This shows that our model learns in particular the commonly repeated wisdom that “markets take

escalators up and elevators down”. This asymmetric policy is a key beneﬁt of the attention-based

model, which cannot easily be replicated by the parametric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or ﬁxed basis pat-

tern benchmark models we compare against. The convolutional subnetwork’s patterns provide

translation invariant information about what kind of trend is present within each 3-day subwindow

of the 30-day cumulative residual price lookback window, which allows the transformer subnetwork

to form a stable attention function that results in this unique policy.

Figure 19 sheds further light on which days and patterns are important. The ﬁgure shows

the normalized average absolute gradient (NAAG) of the allocation weight with respect to various

inputs to intermediate layers in the CNN+Transformer benchmark network. A higher NAAG

indicates a higher importance. Subplot (a) quantiﬁes the importance of the D = 8 diﬀerent basic

patterns. We observe that the ﬂat basic pattern 2 has a negligible weight, while basis patterns that

are needed for trend or reversal patterns have high importance. In (b), we report the importance
of the ﬁrst 27 days of the input residual time series.28 Crucially, all previous days matter, which
emphasizes that the trading allocation depends on the past dynamics. The most recent 14 days

seem to get on average more attention for the trading decisions. However, as indicated in Figure

18, the importance of the days seems to be asymmetric for diﬀerent global patterns.

## 4 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive conceptual framework to compare diﬀerent sta-

tistical arbitrage approaches based on the decomposition into (1) arbitrage portfolio generation,

(2) signal extraction and (3) allocation decision. We develop a novel deep learning statistical ar-

bitrage approach. It uses conditional latent factors to generate arbitrage portfolios. The signal is

estimated with a CNN+Transformer, which combines global dependency patterns with local ﬁlters.

The allocation is estimated with a nonparametric FFN based on a global trading objective.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical out-of-sample study on U.S. equities and demonstrate

the potential of machine learning methods in arbitrage trading. Our CNN+Transformer substan-

tially outperforms all benchmark approaches. The implied trading strategies are not spanned by

conventional risk factors, including price trend factors, and survive realistic transaction and holding

costs. Our model provides insights into optimal trading policies which are based on asymmetric

trend and reversion patterns. In particular, our study shows that the trading signal extraction is

the most challenging and separating element among diﬀerent statistical arbitrage approaches.

Our ﬁndings contribute to the debate on eﬃciency of markets. We quantify the scope of proﬁts

that arbitrageurs can achieve in equity markets. Importantly, the substantial proﬁtability of our

arbitrage strategies is not inconsistent with equilibrium asset pricing, following similar arguments

as in Gatev et al. (2006). It could rather be viewed as empirical evidence about how eﬃciency is

28As the attention head weights are determined relative to the last local 3-day window, that subwindow has

mechanically a larger weight and is not comparable to the other 27 days.

maintained in practice. We document non-declining proﬁtability of arbitrage trading over time,

which suggests that the proﬁts are compensation for arbitrageurs to enforce the law of one price.

### B.2 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model

Following Avellaneda and Lee (2010) and Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017) we model Xt as an

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process

dXt = κ (µ − Xt) dt + σdBt

for a Brownian motion Bt. As the analytical solution of the above stochastic diﬀerential equation
is

Xt+∆t = (1 − e−κ∆t)µ + e−κ∆tXt + σ

e−κ(t+∆t−s)dBs

(cid:90) t+∆t

for any ∆t, we can without loss of generality set ∆t = 1, and estimate the parameters κ, µ and σ

t

from the AR(1) model

Xt+1 = a + bXt + et,

where each et is a normal, independent and identically distributed random variable with mean 0.

validation data from the candidate values cthresh ∈ {1, 1.25, 1.5} and ccrit ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. Our
benchmark model has the values cthresh = 1.25 and ccrit = 0.25, which coincides with the optimal
values in Avellaneda and Lee (2010) and Yeo and Papanicolaou (2017).

### B.3 Convolutional Neural Network with Transformer

#### B.3.1 Convolutional Neural Network

In our empirical application, we consider a 2-layered convolutional network with some standard
technical additions. The network takes as input a window x(0) = x ∈ RL of L consecutive daily
cumulative returns or log prices of a residual, and outputs the feature matrix ˜x ∈ RL×D given by
computing the following quantities for l = 1, . . . , L, d = 1 . . . , D

and b(0), b(1) ∈ RD, W (0) ∈ RD×Dsize and W (1) ∈ RD×D×Dsize are parameters to be estimated.
Compared with the simple convolutional network introduced in the main text, the previous equa-

tions incorporate three standard technical improvements commonly used in deep learning practice.
First, they include “bias terms” b(i) in the ﬁrst part of equations A.7 and A.8 to allow for more
ﬂexible modeling. Second, they include so-called “instance normalization” before each activation

function to speed up the optimization and avoid vanishing gradients caused by the saturation of

the ReLU activations. Third, they include a “residual connection” in equation A.9 to facilitate

gradient propagation during training.

#### B.3.2 Transformer Network

The benchmark model in our empirical application is a one-layer transformer following the

implementation of the seminal paper of Vaswani et al. (2017). Here we provide the general imple-

mentation of the transformer and discuss how it is applied to our problem.

First, for each global pattern 1 ≤ i ≤ H the sequence of features ˜x ∈ RL×D is projected onto

D/H-dimensional subspaces for an integer H dividing D resulting in:

V (i) = ˜xW V
Q(i) = ˜xW Q

i + bV
i + bQ

i ∈ RL×D/H , K(i) = ˜xW K
i ∈ RL×D/H ,

i + bK

i ∈ RL×D/H ,

, W Q

i , W K
i

i ∈ RD/H are parameters to be estimated. For each
where W V
global pattern i = 1, ..., H we obtain the attention function α(i) (., .), which results in the weights
α(i) ∈ RL×L given by

i ∈ RD×D/H , bV

i , bK

i , bQ

α(i)
l,j = α(i) (˜xl, ˜xj)

for i = 1, ..., H and l, j = 1, ..., L,

and calculated as

α(i)
l,j =

· Q(i)
j )
· Q(i)
m )

l

l

(cid:80)L

∈ [0, 1]

for l, j = 1, ..., L.

The projected attention heads h(i) ∈ RL×D/H equal

h(i)
l =

L
(cid:88)

j=1

α(i)
l,j V (i)

j ∈ RD/H for l = 1, ..., L.

These projected heads are then concatenated and linearly combined to obtain the signal matrix

h = Concat(h(1), ..., h(H))W O + bO ∈ RL×D,

where W O ∈ RD×D, bO ∈ RD are parameters to be estimated.

Finally, h is normalized and processed time-wise through a feedforward network similar to the

original paper of Vaswani et al. (2017). This feedforward network corresponds to our allocation

function. In our benchmark model this feedforward neural network has 2 layers. The number of

hidden units in the intermediate layer of the feedforward network is a technical hyperparameter that

we call HDN in Section C.1. This network also has dropout regularization with hyperparameter

called DRP in Section C.1.

Our description of the transformer model learns the time-series dependencies for all points in
the vector x ∈ RL. This is desired for NLP applications, where we want to use future words to
understand the meaning of a word at the beginning of the text. However, in the investment context

we use all information in the past to understand how they aﬀect the ﬁnal point in the time series

61

when we make an investment decision. Hence, conceptually the global pattern at the end of the

time period is the most relevant for the investment objective. Therefore, we use as the trading

signal the last element of the projection h:

θCNN+Trans = hL ∈ RD.

In principle, we can use the complete matrix h ∈ RL×D as the signal. We have also implemented
a transformer that uses the full matrix with similar performance, and the variable importance
rankings show that hL is by far the most important input to the allocation function.
to simplify the notation in the main text and focus on the main insights, we directly deﬁne the
attention function α(i)(˜xL, ˜xj) = αi,j in terms of the last element. The discussion in main text is
simpliﬁed and only includes the dependence with the ﬁnal time-series point.

In order

To provide additional intuition, we discuss the dimensions of the diﬀerent elements of our
benchmark speciﬁcation. The input vectors are cumulative residual returns x ∈ R30. The CNN
ﬁlter represents this time-series in a matrix ˜x ∈ R30×8 of local patterns. For each input time-series,
the transformer obtains H = 4 attention head weights collected in the matrix α ∈ R4×30. The
“loadings” to these patterns are the H = 4 attention heads hi ∈ R2. These are combined to obtain
as the signal the output to the model θCNN+Trans ∈ R8.

### B.4 Network Estimation Details

As explained in Section 2.3, we estimate the parameters of the models with neural networks

by solving the optimization problems introduced in equation (2) or in equation (6) of section 2.3,

depending on the model and the objective function.

In all cases, this is done by replacing the

mean and variance by their annualized sample counterpart over a training set, and by ﬁnding the

optimal network parameters with stochastic gradient descent using PyTorch’s Adam optimizer and

the optimization hyperparameters learning rate and number of optimization epochs described in

detail in section C.1.

As mentioned in Section 3.3, our main results use rolling windows of 1,000 days as training sets.

The networks are reestimated every 125 days to strike a balance between computational eﬃciency

and adaptation to changing economic conditions, and the strategies’ returns are always obtained

out-of-sample. Additionally, to be able to train our model over these long windows without running

into memory issues, we split each training window into temporal “batches”, as is commonly done

in deep learning applications. Each batch contains the returns and residuals for all the stocks in a

subwindow of 125 days of the original training window, with the subwindows being consecutive and

non-overlapping (i.e., for a training window of 1000 days, we split it into the subwindow containing

the ﬁrst 125 days, the subwindow containing the days between the 126th day and the 250th day,

etc.). The optimization process is applied successively to each batch, completing the full sequence

of batches before starting a new optimization iteration or epoch.

In the implementation of our optimization procedure under market frictions, we found it useful

62

to include the last allocation as an additional input to the allocation function w(cid:15), as the inclusion
of the cost term makes the objective function depend on it. However, the inclusion of the previous

allocations in either the objective function or the architecture of the model complicates the paral-

lelization of the training and evaluation computations, because after this change the model requires

the output of previous lookback window in order to compute the output of the current window. To

allow training to remain parallelized, which is desirable for reasonable computational speed given

the volume of data of our empirical application, in our implementation of the training function in

each epoch, we take the previous allocations from the output of the previous epoch and use them

as a pre-computed approximation of the allocations for the current epoch. This approximation

converges in our empirical experiments and allows us to maintain parallelization, but may produce

suboptimal results. For evaluation purposes, however, everything is computed exactly and with no

approximations using a sequential approach.

It is not computationally expensive to train or run inference for our model and the complete

model on a rolling window can be trained and tested end-to-end on the data from 1998–2016 in

less than 7 hours using just two 2017-era NVIDIA Titan V GPUs.

In more detail, throughout

Section 3, all presented results have been computed with PyTorch 1.5 and have been parallelized

across 2 NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan V GPUs, on a server with two Intel Xeon E5-2698v3 32-

core CPUs and 1 TB of RAM. The full rationale for the hyperparameter choices are described in

detail in Section C.1, but for a CNN+Transformer model with a lookback window of 30 days, 8

convolutional ﬁlters with a ﬁlter size of 2, 4 attention heads, 125-day reestimation using a rolling

lookback window of 1000, it takes our deep model less than 7 hours to be completely estimated

and run in our 19 years of daily out-of-sample data with our universe of on average ∼550 stocks

per month.

## C Additional Empirical Results

### C.1 Robustness to Hyperparameter Selection

In this subsection, we describe our hyperparameter selection procedure and explore additional

hyperparameter choices to show that the performance of our strategies is extremely robust to our

choices. These results complement the time stability checks we exhibited in Section 3.9. To decide

which hyperparameters we would select for use in our network, we ﬁxed a validation dataset as

follows: we took the ﬁrst 1000 trading days of our data set of residuals (all trading days from January

20-year rolling window. Because it is solely used for training in our rolling train/test procedures

used to compute strategy returns, this data is completely in-sample, and thus completely avoids

look-ahead bias which would inﬂuence any of our out-of-sample trading results in the main text. We

started with a reasonable set for our hyperparameters, and tested also additional points adjacent

This table shows the parameters for our network architecture with respect to the Sharpe ratio on our validation data and the
candidates we tried In DRP, we follow the convention that the dropout rate p is the proportion of units which are removed.

to these sets.29 For each model represented by a point on the grid, we trained the model using the
Sharpe ratio objective on the ﬁrst 750 days of the 1000 trading days, and evaluated it by its out-

of-sample Sharpe ratio on the last 250 days of the 1000 trading days. We tested 16 combinations

of hyperparameters, which are illustrated in Table A.II. The results of our test on the last 250 days

of our validation data are displayed in Table A.III.

The results in Table A.III show that all Sharpe ratios fall within a tight range of values, which

is roughly [3.5, 4.2]. Means and volatilities concentrate similarly, falling within [13%, 17.8%] and

[3.6%, 4.3%]. Computation of 95% bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals for mean return shows that

all models’ conﬁdence intervals contain the interval [10%, 20%], with volatilies similarly contained.

Hence, these models are statistically not distinguishable. Given the statistical insigniﬁcance of the

diﬀerences in performance of these models, we chose the model displayed in Table A.II, which is

the most parsimonious one, that is it has the smallest number of parameters, and hence beneﬁts

low GPU memory usage and ease of interpretability.

To ensure that our results are stable across several choices of hyperparameters, we study the re-

sults of four additional models with perturbed hyperparameters. This complements our robustness

results of Section 3.9 regarding the size of the lookback window and the retraining frequency. The

four additional networks and their hyperparameter conﬁgurations are listed in Table A.IV, with

Network 1 being the network studied throughout this empirical section. Network 2 corresponds to

more ﬁlters and commensurately more hidden units to consume them, and higher dropout rates

to more strongly regularize the additional parameters. Network 3 halves the number of attention

heads from our original speciﬁcation. Networks 4 and 5 modify the size of the rolling training win-

dow from 1000 trading days to 1250 and 750 trading days, respectively, which corresponds closely

to three and ﬁve calendar years. These additional hyperparameter conﬁgurations constitute local

perturbations in hyperparameter space, to which our strategies’ performance are relatively robust.

29Note the computation over a large set of hyperparameters is computationally infeasible, which requires us to

restrict the set to reasonable values.

In Table A.V, we report the results of these models on a representative subset of 5-factor mod-

els, which are now evaluated on the full out-of-sample data. We see that the Sharpe ratios are

broadly similar across all three diﬀerent perturbations of network architecture hyperparameters

(i.e., number of ﬁlters, number of attention heads, and dropout rate). The small range of values

induced by these choices shows that our network performs similarly over a variety of sensible net-

work parameters, and highlights the eﬃcacy of our reasonable choice of convolutional, attentional,

and feedforward subnetworks which specialize in ﬁnding small temporal patterns, arranging these

patterns throughout time, and deciding on allocations based on these arranged patterns.

For the allocation function feedforward network (FFN) utilized for the Fourier+FFN model,

we choose a reasonable architecture based on deep learning conventions and have veriﬁed that the

results are robust to this choice. Because the input of the network are the L = 30 coeﬃcients of the
Fourier decomposition of each residual window (X (n,t)
)1≤l≤L and the output is the corresponding
allocation weight wn,t ∈ R, we follow standard deep learning practices and consider 3 hidden
layers with dimensions 16,8,4 regularized with a dropout rate of 0.25. We use the ReLU activation

l

function, and train using the same procedure outlined in B.4, with the same batch size, learning

rate, number of optimization epochs, and optimization method as in Table A.II.

residual is a representative empirical example. In more detail, we consider the residuals from ﬁve IPCA factors and estimate
the benchmark models as explained in Section 3.15. The left subplots display the cumulative residual process along with the
out-of-sample allocation weights w(cid:15)|·
that each model assigns to this speciﬁc residual. In this example, we consider trading
only this speciﬁc residual and hence normalize the weights to {−1, 0, 1}. The middle column plots show the time-series of
estimated out-of-sample signals for each model, by applying the θ·
l arbitrage signal function to the previous L cumulative
returns of the residual. The right column plots display the out-of-sample cumulative returns of trading this particular residual
based on the corresponding allocation weights. We use a rolling lookback window of L = 30 days to estimate the signal and
allocation, which we evaluate for the out-of-sample trading on the next 30 days. The plots only show the out-of-sample period.
The evaluation of this illustrative example is a simpliﬁcation of the general model that we use in our empirical main analysis,
where we trade all residuals and map them back into the original stock returns.

to obtain the residuals. We run a time-series regression of the out-of-sample returns of the arbitrage strategies on the 8-
factor model (Fama-French 5 factors + momentum + short-term reversal + long-term reversal) and report the annualized α,
accompanying t-statistic value tα, and the R2 of the regression. In addition, we report the annualized mean return µ along

This table reports the correlations of our CNN+Transformer strategies for some representative choices of the factor models.
The correlations are calculated with returns of the out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to December 2016. The
models are calibrated on a rolling window of four years and use the Sharpe ratio objective function. The signals are extracted
from a rolling window of L = 30 days.

### C.5 Time-Series Signal

In this appendix, we report the OOS returns of strategies using alternative models for the

ablation tests in Section 3. For the FFN feedforward network, we use the same architecture,

hyperparameters, optimization settings, etc. as in the Fourier+FFN model utilized throughout the

empirical results section and described in Appendix C.1. For the OU+FFN model, because the
input is the low-dimensional OU signal in R4, we consider a 3 hidden layer with dimensions 4,4,4
regularized with a dropout rate of 0.25. We use the sigmoid activation function, and estimate it

using the same procedure outlined in section B.4, with the same batch size, learning rate, number

of optimization epochs, and optimization method as in Table A.II.

This table shows the out-of-sample annualized Sharpe ratio (SR), mean return (µ), and volatility (σ) of our three statistical
arbitrage models for diﬀerent numbers of risk factors K, that we use to obtain the residuals. We use the daily out-of-
sample residuals from January 1998 to December 2016 and evaluate the out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to
December 2016. OU+FFN denotes a parametric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model to extract the signal, but a ﬂexible feedforward
neural network to estimate the allocation function. FFN takes the residuals directly as signals and estimates an allocation
function with a feedforward neural network. The deep learning models are calibrated on a rolling window of four years and
use the Sharpe ratio objective function. The signals are extracted from a rolling window of L = 30 days. The K = 0 factor
model corresponds to directly using stock returns instead of residuals for the signal and trading policy.

2016 and evaluate the out-of-sample arbitrage trading from January 2002 to December 2016. The models are calibrated
on a rolling window of four years and use either the Sharpe ratio or mean-variance objective function with trading costs

### C.7 Portfolio Concentration

Figure A.5: Industry Concentration of Portfolio Weights

This ﬁgure shows the rolling 132-day industry concentration of portfolio weights standardized by the population industry
concentration. The stock portfolio weights wR
t are for the empirical benchmark CNN+Transformer model based on IPCA
5-factor residuals and for the out-of-sample trading period between January 2002 and December 2016. We use standard SIC
industry classiﬁcations.

### C.8 Market Eﬃciency Over Time

The average volatility of residuals seems to decreases over time. We conjecture that we observe

this pattern due to increasing market eﬃciency over time. This might also be the reason why

the turnover exhibits a decreasing trend after incorporating trading frictions. The higher market

eﬃciency can push the exploitable amount of proﬁtability close to the limits of arbitrage after

trading costs are applied.

To provide further support for this hypothesis, we study the volatilities of residuals over time.

Figure A.6 shows the cross-sectional mean and the 95% quantiles of the residual volatilities based

on the IPCA-5 factor model for the out-of-sample time period. As can be seen, the mean volatility

decreases over time.

Figure A.6: Volatility of Residuals over Time

This ﬁgure shows the volatility of residuals over time. We plot the cross-sectional mean and the 95% quantiles of residual
volatility based on the IPCA-5 factor model. The mean and quantile time-series are smoothed over one calendar month for
better legibility.

Figure A.7 shows the out-of-sample cumulative returns after transaction costs for our benchmark

model. It conﬁrms that volatile time periods like the ﬁnancial crisis can lead to proﬁtable statistical

arbitrage opportunities.
